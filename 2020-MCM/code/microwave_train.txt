after reading either terrible or &#34;hit and miss&#34; reviews of other small footprint microwaves with &#34;handle doors&#34; rather than &#34;push button&#34; I came across this from Whirlpool..It had GREAT reviews so I tried it for our new granite countertop (didn't want to use up much space)... it is PERFECT!!|pos
The unit was purchased to replace an old whirlpool unit that had performed flawlessly for 20 years. Although none of the holes lined up the Sharp unit fit perfectly into the space above our cooktop. So far the unit has performed as advertised.|pos
I bought this microwave about two years ago, and it still looks and functions great!  Have not had a single issue. :)|pos
Just moved into apartment where this had been installed new. Cooks OK so far (although not encouraged by the rest of the reviews here) but otherwise designed to frustrate -- minor features you've taken for granted after several decades of microwaving are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />- As others have mentioned, the three obnoxiously long beeps after cooking are bad enough; that they don't stop once you've opened the door is bonkers. And once you've opened the door, you're committed -- hit Clear all you want, you're getting the beeps. HOWEVER, if you hit Clear BEFORE you open the door, you can snip the beeps, which is good but why is the sequence an issue at all?<br /><br />- Can't set the timer and cook concurrently. Sorry multitaskers.<br /><br />- Clock gains between 2-3 minutes each day -- last synced with the stove (same brand, brand new) a month ago, and they're now 2 1/2 hours apart.<br /><br />- No way to open or close the door quietly, can only jerk it open and pop it shut.|neg
One of the pieces that ensures the screws from the top of the cabinet holds the microwave in place was missing, so we cannot install it until Samsung rectifies the matter.  Seems crazy to send it back though since it's just missing a 50 cent bolt that can't be replaced at the hardware store.....|neg
This is stuff. It really worked very well. It save me a great deal of money having to replace a microwave that still works very well. I highly recommend this product.|pos
As all the other reviews have said, the footprint of this microwave is fantastic. I can't believe other companies have not copied the shape of this microwave. I now have so much more room on my counter.<br />The only quirk that takes a little getting used to is not having number keys to punch in the time. The start button adds thirty seconds every time it's hit or you can add the + key to get a more accurate time. I always use my microwave for quick reheating so it's not a big deal to me. Worth getting used to for the extra space gained. Plus, it microwaves as quickly as its replacement even though the wattage is less.|pos
I researched many microwaves for our needs, and this is the perfect unit. It is my second one, as the first I had special ordered to be delivered to a big box store, it arrived damaged. This one arrived fine, well packaged for the trip. It cooks evenly in the convection mode and as a microwave it is fabulous. It arrived when promised. I would definitely buy from this seller again.|pos
Had this microwave for 3 years with very little usage within that period of time. The infamous F7 error code showed up and service rep replaced the inverter and still had a problem after inverter replacement. After a $400 repair bill, the inverter was only partial problem. The magnetron has to be replaced for another $200. Whirlpool use to be a great appliance to purchase but now I would not suggest buying another whirlpool appliance.|neg
yeayy I love this microwave it takes such a small space in my tiny kitchen but it is huge inside !! it has popcorn button as well !!|pos
This is the SECOND one of these that has blown up on me in 8 months. I don't recommend it at all.|neg
This is an absolute crappy microwave. I'm thankful I didn't spend a dime on it since it was a Christmas Present. The entire appliance is shoddy. After using it for about a year, the door handle began to show cracks and eventually just cracked completely which compromised the glass panel on the front door. Eventually the entire circuit board shorted out when I was simply changing the light bulb. My husband and I did not misuse this appliance and we certainly  weren't &#34; hard&#34; on it. It's simply a poorly made appliance.|neg
Piece of junk. Got two years of use and it died. Customer service says too bad. Whirlpool dishwasher died a few months ago. Whirlpool is dead to me.|neg
during the kitchen remodel we decided to install a commercial type exhaust fan and eliminated the typical microwave location about the stove.  This thing is cool, push a button and the drawer opens, drop in your food, push another button and the drawer closes.|pos
I did not buy this microwave on Amazon, but felt compelled to add to the feedback as I buy many other products here using the customer reviews.  I bought this microwave 2 years and 2 weeks ago.  It completely failed last night.  It was running as normal, got very loud, then completely died.  I've reset breakers and checked that power is still being supplied.  Everything checks out.  Samsung wants $288 for the service contract to fix it, but as of this posting, that's how much a new microwave costs.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this microwave.|neg
Purchase was a good one.  Love the design of the microwave, and so far it meets all my needs.  Being short, the drawer is much more comfortable for me.  The process of ordering and receiving from Amazon was simple, efficient and has been one of the best purchases I've made in the whole kitchen reno project. Thanks Amazon.|pos
We bought this microwave as part of a kitchen remodel 2 years ago. We have loved it from day one. Being able to open and stir things or just lift things out is so convenient. The kids love it and always enjoy using it. It has a lot of settings and features which we use regularly. The fact that there's a turn table does not bother me. I have not noticed any uneven heating. We have enjoyed it so much that we just bought another one to put in the kitchen of the new house we just bought. I have never regretted this purchase, and neither will you!|pos
Did the job. Great coverage. Made the inside of the microwave look almost brand new. Very satisfied.  Would purchase again|pos
So far, so good.  I have no complaints, but it's only been in use for about 6 months.  If I start noticing the same wear and tear (i.e. peeling paint on the interior), I'll post an update.  We use this appliance several times a day, everyday.|pos
Worked fine for 13 months then it stop heating food and it does not show any error messages. Searched on online for a solution to the problem and found that running the fan on high works for some people. I gave it a try and YES it does work. The only way to heat our food is by turning the fan on HIGH before setting the time and pushing the start button. Our microwave is installed under a cabinet but not above any stove or range, so steam or moisture is not the problem. I called Samsung and their only solution was for me to buy their extended warranty for $250.00 for one year. I told them No Thanks, if I'm going to spend more money on a microwave it won't be on a Sumsung.|neg
After the smoke has cleared from the house, discovered microwave burnt out.  Thank God for Home Warranty!  Don't buy! YUCK!  Can't believe the reviews- all universally the same, except mine lasted just under a year!  It's a crying shame a product fails so soon!|neg
It's a nice looking Microwave and it does a great job (when it works). Ours failed 2 weeks after the warranty expired. Repair cost was more than buying a new one so we ended up getting a new one.|neg
The clock runs fast, gaining about 5 minutes ever day. It also heats very unevenly. We've owned it for a month. I'm looking forward to the total breakdown described on the rest of these reviews so that I can get a new one.|neg
This Kenmore microwave eats microwave tubes like 1 every year. Since tubes are now made in far east, instead of by Raytheon, quality as dropped, I now expect to replace tube yearly and budget for it. It was nice to find a tube with diode (which has never failed) for such a great price.|pos
This saved us from needing to buy a new microwave/ oven combo. Easy to use.  We used it to fix our microwave about 2 months ago and it's held up.|pos
Very high quality product. This paint spayed right on with minimal dust and adhered right to the microwave for a smooth finish.|pos
I needed a small, compact microwave. This is perfect if you have limited counter space. The depth is good. It will hold a dinner plate but the interior height is shorter than a regular size microwave. This is because the controls are on the lower panel instead of on the side. The control buttons are simple but intuitive.|pos
I ordered and it was very fast shipping about couple days.<br />My turntable engine was broken after 10 years used my microwave.<br />I'm very easy removed old engine and put new one.<br />Quality product and parts was new.<br />Highly recommended this seller.|pos
DO NOT BUY!<br />We just got the SE error after 2.5 years - they know about the problem and haven't fixed it.  I looked it up on the internet after this happened and tons of people have this problem.  I'm not going to pull the whole thing apart to fix it and then have it happen again.  If they know the moisture causes the key pad to fail then why do they have it above a range where you boil water!|neg
I was looking for the microwave with certain size with a basic function. I was so happy to find this product at Amazon.<br />The first one arrived last week, but I had to return it next day. It made clicking noise when I closed the door. It also make some noises when I push &#34;Start&#34; button.<br />The second one, I received today and connect, set up clock, and start with a cup of water to make sure it works.  I felt bad returning the same product twice.<br />This time, I called Whirlpool customer service. The personnel told me the information she has is the same &#34;product guide&#34; (which comes with the product).|neg
Love this little microwave! It is the perfect size (holds just a dinner plate) and LOVE that it does not take up a tremendous amount of room. We don't use it for much other than occasionally heating something up (1-2x month) or steaming vegetables, so I can't speak to how it does for heavy use.|pos
Microwave didn't work when I received it.  It was really disappointing.  It was a great looking microwave but very sad to have to return it.|neg
I bought this because the counter footprint and wattage were both low. I didn't expect very intuitive controls, a super easy-to-clean interior, weirdly efficient heating (stuff gets hot FAST) and thoughtful design touches like an interior light that switches off with disuse, and a polite, non-obnoxious &#34;your stuff is done&#34; beep that only goes off a few times before quieting down. It's a great little microwave. Bit tall, but that should be obvious from the pictures.  Update: Died in 2017 after years of faithful service, and I'm going to replace it with the same model. It has a totally unmatched capacity to footprint ratio, and I'm really annoyed that no one else is making microwaves that stack the mechanical bits under or over the food cavity. This is obviously the better way to build a microwave.|pos
While searching for others with the same problem we're having I found these reviews: our Advantium died in about 2 1/2 years. We work from home and, one day, smelled smoke that we traced to our Advantium which was turned off and that had been turned off for some time. It was hot to the touch. We unplugged the Advantium and the the smoke smell went away: it had spontaneously turned on and was melting itself down. Plugging it back in turns it on without pressing any buttons. GE says this is not a fire hazard because there are supposed to be safety's to prevent it from burning down the house. I'm not so sure -- their credibility is shot -- but even if there are those safety's are built with the same low quality as the Advantium so cannot be reasonably relied upon. GE says the problem is with the keypad but that there aren't any more keypads to buy, probably because they all fail. The Advantium is a piece of junk. Save yourself money and protect your family from this potential fire hazard: avoid GE appliances.    [Update: after several calls and an eternity on hold GE acknowledged the problem and send a tech with a new Advantium that seems to be working well. I wouldn't buy another -- there are clearly QA issues with the Advantium -- but after lots of time on the phone GE did make this right. I'd still prefer a different manufacturer though and wish I'd bought a different cooker. If you're in the market for a microwave/cooker buy a different one.]|neg
DESCRIPTION<br />&#62; Can be mounted in a 24&#34; wide X 12&#34; deep space.  Not intended to be installed above a range (standard ranges are 30&#34; wide), does not include a built-in hood for use above a range.<br />&#62; Has the great simple operation of previous Spacemakers: for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute, place it in the microwave and press &#34;1&#34;.  That's all.<br />&#62; Well built, albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old Spacemaker II.<br />&#62; Quieter than my old Spacemaker II--although that's no big deal.<br />&#62; The turntable is a nice addition (my old Spacemaker II did not have a turntable), but reduces the total space available (unless you turn the turntable off).<br />&#62; Has all of the controls and options of my old Spacemaker II:<br />...Plus popcorn, &#34;beverage&#34;, &#34;reheat&#34;, &#34;chicken/fish&#34;, &#34;potato&#34;, and &#34;vegetable&#34; buttons (which I probably won't use because I like to know what the microwave is doing).<br />...Other new buttons are &#34;delay start&#34;, &#34;reminder&#34;, &#34;turntable on/off&#34;, and &#34;add 30 sec&#34;.  The &#34;add 30 sec&#34; works on its own, you can press it and get just 30 seconds OR add 30 seconds to any time.  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee, or heating some pastries.<br />...There is a child lockout, but without a dedicated button.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION<br />&#62; The microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes, but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all cases.<br />&#62; The microwave hangs from four ~1 1/4&#34;-long machine screws, which are inserted from above, from inside the cabinet above.  If the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1/2&#34; thick, then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1/2&#34;.<br />&#62; Hypothetically, you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store, and 4 big washers (e.g., 2&#34; in diameter).  However the installation kit is probably easier.<br />&#62; If you use the template, double check the logic, and adjust the location of the screw holes accordingly.<br />... The key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet. You usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet.  (That is, the front holes should be approximately 3 1/4&#34; back from the front of the closed doors).<br />... The door of the microwave needs an extra 1/8&#34; on the left in order to open fully, and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave.  If there is an obstruction on the left side (such as wall, cabinet, or refrigerator), you may wish to shift the holes 1/4&#34; to the right, if you can.<br /><br />UNDERCOUNTER INSTALLATION KIT<br />&#62; If this is an new undercounter installation, or the space between the front and back screw holes (inside the cabinet above the microwave) is not ~6 1/4&#34;, then you need GE part #WX4-A019 [[ASIN:B001H815TO GE Part Number WX4-A019 UNDER CAB MT]].  If you are replacing a Spacemaker with a distance of ~6 1/4&#34; between the front and back holes, then you probably do NOT need an installation kit.<br /><br />IF YOU ARE REPLACING AN OLD SPACEMAKER II (for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is ~7 3/4&#34;)...<br />&#62; I purchased this Profile Spacemaker to replace a 23-year old Spacemaker II.  But neither the holes, backing plate, nor the screws were the same.<br />&#62; The spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; The lateral spacing (side-to-side) between the screw holes is the same 19 15/32&#34; for my old Spacemaker II and this new Profile Spacemaker.<br />&#62; But the spacing between the front and rear holes is NOT the same (the new spacing is 6 1/4&#34;).<br />&#62;So, if the holes in your cabinet are for the old Spacemaker II, then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this Profile Spacemaker.  Draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes, measure 6 1/4&#34; back from the center of the front hole, and drill the new hole there.<br />&#62; The screws seem to be very similar, but a slightly different diameter or pitch (perhaps they are metric). Hypothetically, you could drill new holes in the old backing plate (or use washers instead of the backing plate), and find screws the right size and length, but I decided to purchase the new kit instead.<br /><br />BEFORE YOU REPLACE A DEAD MICROWAVE OVEN ...<br />&#62; My old Spacemaker II died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges (lightning).  I accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset.  I've had the same experience with several other appliances.<br />&#62; Even refrigerators and clothes driers have built-in computers these days.  If any electric appliance is not working properly, unplug it, and leave it unplugged a while.  For some reason (perhaps large capacitors in the circuit) big appliances usually need hours to reset.<br /><br />RELIABILITY<br />If my experience with my old Spacemaker II is any indication, this Profile Spacemaker should be very reliable.  Although resurrected 3 times over 23 years, my old Spacemaker was still working when I &#34;took it out of service&#34;.  After 23 years of daily use, some of the white finish was turning yellow, there were patches of rust inside, and the door switch (which turns the light on and off) was erratic.<br /><br />IF YOUR OLD SPACEMAKER HAD A TRAY INSTEAD OF A TURNTABLE, keep the tray from your old microwave.<br />&#62; The tray will fit in your new Profile Spacemaker.  The tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnt-on spills (which may promote rust in the future).<br />&#62; I use the glass tray when I'm using a large rectangular casserole, or many small containers.  I often warm two 12&#34; diameter full plates of food---I use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlap.<br />&#62; If you use the tray, lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive, then place the glass tray in the bottom.<br /><br />GENERAL HINTS ON MICROWAVE COOKING<br />It is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking, so the key to cooking many items (especially vegies) is to generate and hold that steam.<br />&#62; If you are warming bread, wrap it in a towel.  It is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be.  If the bread is rock hard, slightly dampen the towel, and use half-power--the warm bread will be soft and fresh.  Heat only briefly and/or at reduced power.<br />&#62; You can even bake potatoes or roast ears of corn-on-the-cob in a microwave, if you wrap them in a damp cloth towel.<br />&#62; Rinse vegetables before you cook them---that washes off any pesticides etc., and the extra water will produce extra steam.  If the vegies are dehydrated after long storage, you may want to soak them a few hours ahead to time to re-hydrate them.<br />&#62; It is usually best NOT to boil vegies in a container of water in a microwave, because the excess formation of steam LOWERS the cooking temperature.  Your goal should be to create a little steam, contain it, and superheat it.  (This is the same principle as a pressure cooker).<br />&#62; Stir some oil (e.g., olive) oil with cut vegetables---a coating of oil will help hold the steam inside the individual pieces of vegetable.<br />&#62; A selection of glass casseroles of a range of sizes with glass lids can be essential for microwave cooking.  The goal is that the vegies fill the container and the container is covered with a lid---so that the steam is concentrated.

Fits beautifully in a corner of my kitchen so much better than a full sized rectangular one ever did.  Because the controls are on the bottom (instead of the side) the door is higher and it easily clears the edge of the sink next to it and, occasionally, drying dishes without having to move anything.<br /><br />Love the sleekness of the look and simplicity of the controls.  Miss the number pad a bit, but knew it didn't have one when I bought it and am quickly adjusting.  Power control and basic instructions on what setting to use have been helpful (couldn't even figure out power setting on previously owned machine!).  Oh and the very short beeps at the end of a cycle are not nearly as annoying as the longer ones on other models I have owned.<br /><br />We typically use for reheating food (single or multiple servings) or beverages and the occasional bowl of popcorn and it heats quite well.  In fact, the popcorn button is the only part I completely dislike, as it is preset for only 1.75 oz bags and cannot be changed.  We gave up preservative laden pre-packaged bags of popcorn years ago in favor of real kernels using a special bowl or paper bag, so the popcorn setting is useless for us.  Have not noticed any difference in heating between this and previous full size model we owned, except that beverages seem to heat faster.  Full sized plates fit and have had no issue with container heights (even my large popcorn bowl fits nicely).<br /><br />Bought the white version online at Home Depot, as their price was actually better than Amazon's and included free delivery as well.  Definitely recommend to anyone looking for a smaller microwave.|pos
I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE microwave because fit in the space I have, and also look good, but let me tell you if you thinking buying some thing like this PICE OF JUNK, only going to last you the most 2 years, or less that is what it lass me, when you call GE they ready to sell you a new one problably with the same problems.|neg
fits perfect and works great never thought I would find one that would fit my kitchen in stainless steel look|pos
Worthless.  Stopped working after less than two years.  The repair place said it would be about $200.00 to fix it.  If you're like me, you are considering a Frigidaire because they're cheaper.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little more on another brand.|neg
I just finished remodeling my kitchen a few months ago. I was trying to go for something different in putting together my design and I thought this would not only be cool, it would free up some valuable counter space. I was a little concerned upon reading some of the reviews from some who have purchased this microwave and aren't too thrilled with it's performance however upon much consideration, I decided to take the chance and as Nike says, Just do It. I have been using my microwave religiously since June and it has been nothing but the best. It looks sleek and cool built into my cherry cabinet. The performance of the unit has been trouble free to date and overall, I would not hesitate to buy it again.|pos
The poor reviews of this product must have involved a bad batch. This microwave has worked great for us. Very powerful great look and fits in a very tight space. I really like the one touch timer feature. It seems to be well built. Ours has a sticker inside that says built April 2013. I am glad we got a more recent built unit than what seems to be problems with earlier units.|pos
I put a SMH9187ST 1.8 cu. ft. Over-the-Range Microwave (Stainless Steel) in my vacation home.  After four or five months of light duty use, we returned home to find the door standing open and the light on inside.  There is apparently a spring in the door that holds the two latches in the closed position.  That spring either came off its mount or broke, because the latches no longer hold the door closed.  I asked Samsung to tell me how to open up the door so I could replace the spring.  They said no, I'd have to pay them for a service call.  I asked if they would tell me how to remove the door so I could take it to a local repair shop.  No, again.  Keep in mind that the spring apparently failed while the unit was just sitting there, not in use.  The really scary part of this is that if it had failed during use, the door would have opened on its own potentially allowing a major leakage of microwave energy into the kitchen.  ,|neg
This microwave works well and is efficient. It does make more noise than my last one but it makes up for it in performance. Would not hesitate to purchase again.|pos
This little giant is great for small spaces. It is very easy to use and works just as well as larger microwaves. I am very happy with purchase.|pos
Bought under 3 years ago.  First the door stopped closing fully unless you slammed it.  Now all it does is work for 5 seconds and then stops working.  Total JUNK!  Total waste of money.  Now I need to buy a new microwave...AGAIN!|neg
This was bought as part of a package of kitchen equipment in May 2013.<br /><br />Currently it hasn't worked for 1/4 of the time I have owned it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have identified there is a known issue where they stop working and don't response at all - Samsung executive customer service refuses to do anything outside the attempt to 'repair it 3 times process'.<br /><br />There is nothing good to say about Samsung, their product, their staff or their agencies - to continue to sell a product that is known to be deficient is negligent<br /><br />I own other Samsung products but because of this I will never buy one again and make sure I can influence others to do likewise.<br /><br />Please don't buy this product - it will most likely fail and you will wish you hadn't...<br /><br />I certainly regret it|neg
This kit is just what I needed.  My microwave stopped warming food and made a loud buzzing sound when on.  I didn't want to replace the whole unit because it matched my stove.  I got this kit and it was really pretty easy to install.  Now it works like new again.<br /><br />***There are dangers of electric shock, so do your research.***<br /><br />*Keep track of all your screws and bolts and where they go.*|pos
It was ok. Convection and bake worked OK. A lot of buttons to push just to get it to go. Usually I hit the 30 second button and then turned the knob. Also cannot see non illuminated buttons in a semi- dark corner of kitchen. However, the unit stopped working after 17 months. Just passed the warranty. Not happy.|neg
I received on time, but with damage on the door and left side and with out grill,I'm not so happy|neg
Very disappointed, because this is the perfectly shaped microwave for our kitchen. But my husband reported a big, scary electrical storm (and bad smell = burning machine?) inside the unit yesterday, along with a weird dark brown spot on the inside of the machine. He was melting butter in a Pyrex bowl. Today, the microwave is headed for appliance recycling.<br /><br />Importantly, we only used the unit at most once or twice per day, to warm or melt things.|neg
We bought this Microwave at Lowes.  I think I would have a better chance at solving a Rubik's than installing the thing over the stove so we hired our handyman to do it.<br /><br />The microwave performs OK but the stainless steel began rusting in 9 months.  It is now pockmarked with rust and getting uglier every day.<br /><br />I regret this purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Here I am a little more than a year after posting my original 1-star review, and I'm wishing there was zero star option.  One day about 2 hours after dinner the light inside the microwave randomly came on all by itself! The unit was previously off. Upon closer inspection we noticed not only was the light on, but the turntable was also turning. If we open the door, the turntable stops spinning. If we close it, it begins again. And the light remains on.<br /><br />Sometimes when we're done cooking something it will power off normally like its supposed to and we get lulled into a false sense that it fixed itself. But then it will randomly come on again later.<br /><br />It's acting like its possessed.  My guess is that all LG products are pure evil, and should be avoided.|neg
Samsung might make tons of nice product but Oven range Microwave is not one of them. Seems like 5E or SE code seems to be the common problem with their microwave.<br />My warranty was just about to run out and I've been getting this code. I should have doing research before I went with them. Live and learn I suppose.|neg
Amazing that such a reputable company would put out such a poorly thought out product.<br /><br />Everyone should know by now that the most important part of a microwave oven is the user interface.  Afterall, a microwave oven has one power setting that must be somehow regulated by an on/off switch  - so I am amazed that Frigidaire could mess that up so.<br /><br />For instance:  when it is done cooking - the 3 loud beeps go off VERY SLOWLY.  During which time it is impossible to add time, or even to stop the beeping.  You can open the door, but it still beeps;  you can not push the stop button, because until the beep is done - NOTHING ELSE WORKS -  This thing is robbing my time a few seconds at a time.<br /><br />Who is the Frigidaire executive that pushed this forward with out simple end user testing?<br /><br />Skip it... Underpowered for it's size and frustrating to use.|neg
18 month old microwave will not stop running until unplugged, which is a complete fire hazard and deemed unsafe.  I will never purchase a Frigidaire product in my lifetime again, or recommend it to anyone.  This is not the first 18 month old Frigidaire product I will have to replace.  STOP NOW if you are considering this product brand!!!|neg
This met our requirements for a space saving microwave.  We would recommend it to any one with limited counter space.|pos
It worked for three weeks and now it won't start. Luckily we kept the box and are sending it back. What a pain.|neg
Bought this product a while ago. Handle breaks off over time. GE knows of the problem. Charges $60 for the handle and delivers it without screws. One of those broke as well. On line parts support says the handle does not come with screws and there is nothing they can do. Live and learn.|neg
When ordering cabinet for microwave I had no clue that Sharp offered a drawer oven that would fit into the cabinet perfectly.  It looks so great and works beautifully.|pos
I should have heeded the warnings in these reviews.  We bought this because it fit our space, but the door button broke.  The door won't open when the button is pushed, it just unlatches and you have to pry it open.  What's worse, the GE repairman came to fix it and he just added some lubrication and said it was fine.  He refused to replace anything.|neg
We got it the same day our cabinets were being installed. We were worried about it not working since this was our first on-line purchase of such a high priced item. Let me tell you how easy it went in and it performed FANTASTIC!!!! it is exactly what we wanted and the slide out drawer has our friends looking into how they can install one in their kitchens. We installed it in a bottom cabinet directly under the countertop. great height and so convenient to place hot items right onto the countertop. No more reaching over head or over a hot stove to get anything out. This is a real gem and an awesome addition to our kitchen.|pos
Bought this for a small kitchen, it fits nicely in the corner and works great. Seems to be well-made. Although it is lower wattage, I have not had to significantly increase the cooking time, and I can fit a plate or even cook/reheat in a round 2qt dish. The beep is a little loud but otherwise no complaints.|pos
Bought Over The Range GE Microwave PVM1790SR1 SS Unpacked it. Before installing , plugged it in to test.It started automatically, control panel went dark no amount of pressin STOP/CANCEL button would stop it from running.<br />Returned the product yesterday.|neg
So far it has worked fine with no service calls.  I will keep you posted in future years.  Given how nicely it fits in our kitchen island, I would probably buy another one even if it lasted only 2 years.  Update:  Finished year 4 with no problems.  Still very happy.|pos
The ceiling of my microwave was a disaster. Paint was peeling all over it. This product did the trick. Make sure you sand properly and spray several light coats rather than one thick one.|pos
Same as every one else..this microwave is three years old ..broke twice ! They know they have an SE problem and continue to sell their junk!  Same as everyone else they want you to pay to fix it...told us last time we got it fixed they resolved the problem...well broke again SE AGAIN ..so I will never buy from them again...I will tell everyone I know not to buy their junk ..is it really worth it to screw people over like that?|neg
My regular glasses can't fit in so keep that in mind, you'll need shorter glasses. Its footprint is a winner, even though I got tons of real estate on my countertop already, I still appreciate how much space it frees up when compared to my big ass conventional MW. I do miss the analog dial (to set minutes) on my old MW though, touching these touch-sensitive totally flat buttons is just so unnatural.  I regret that I didn't buy this earlier.|pos
After 16 months the board that controls the keypad died. The repair estimate was twice what I paid for the microwave! Repair person told me to get a whirlpool or LG next time.|neg
Bought this cutie for the outdoor kitchen in my RV.  I had limited space to work with so this was the perfect choice for me.  The unit sits in one corner of the outdooor kitchen counter leaving me enough room to add a hot plate as well.<br /><br />Great item at a great price.  Enough power to handle all routoine microwave tasks.|pos
I have just gone through 10 weeks of kitchen remodel that was supposed to take 5-6 weeks. I researched venting microwaves and found very good reports on this one. The availability and price here on Amazon beat my local big box stores and chains. Installation appeared easy for my contractors. There are options to allow venting outside, either behind or above the microwave (not so clear from product description) but we had planned to vent through filters as the only other option was through our garage (not compatible with local code).<br /><br />The bells and whistles are amazing, with our kids ready to show us how it works, right after we stop the clock blinking on our VCR.|pos
Had large amount of rust under rotating plate in GE microwave.  Surface prep is important.  I started out with sandpaper and discovered this was going to take too long due to the amount of rust I had.  I ended up using a 1&#34; metal paint scraper to remove all paint/rust down to base metal in the damaged area, this worked very well.  Then sanded smooth.  Wiped surface clean with rubbing alcohol. Masked off area to be painted.  Ensure adequate ventilation when painting.  I applied mutliple coats.  2 months of usage thus far... looks great, holding up great!|pos
We own this microwave in black. Installed in 2010, slow to cook for 3 years, and finally broke in 2013 - magnetron went out. Too costly to repair, so replaced with a Whirlpool unit (fingers crossed). 3 years for an appliance that requires install - WHAT A JOKE! I also had a GE range break in less than 3 years. I own multiple rental houses and used to count on GE. Now I will NEVER buy a GE appliance again!|neg
It is so nice! it works, is small, has a wonderful shape, it is an acquisition for my kitchen. I recommend it.|pos
After about 10 uses...yes, 10 uses, the microwave heating element broke.  It was under warranty but this product is horrible.  all looks, no performance.  Filing a BBB complaint and one with Sharp as well.  $1K is too much for this bag of magic beans.|neg
After following the instructions it fixed my rusty microwave oven. I'm happy I had found this product. Now I don't have to pay a costly repair bill.|pos
I needed a microwave that would handle large dinner plates but took no space.  This item fits the bill perfectly.  It fits neatly into a corner of my countertop, in no way dominates the area, and functions way beyond what I expected.  If you are looking for a compact microwave that handles big things this is it.  Don't hesitate to purchase it.  Highly recommended.|pos
Late last year we remodeled our kitchen. We put in top of the line Wolf/Sub Zero appliances that we always wanted, but we let our salesperson talk us into this Sharp microwave. This microwave hasn't even been in a year and the door is already separating from the glass (hard to understand since it is the one appliance that we rarely use-I am in a rigorous school program and my husband travels for work). I can almost fit my pinky finger into the gap that has formed between the door and the glass. The microwave is used maybe once a week for a reheat after a late shift. When I called Sharp about this issue, I was transferred to every department until finally the one I needed was closed. Yep transferred to different departments only to be told that they couldn't help and the one that could help me was closed for the evening. I called at 1pm MST. This is so frustrating to have my beautiful dream kitchen with this eyesore coming apart...who knows how they will have to rip it out. I am off to buy a Wolf drawer microwave; their helpful customer service goes out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.|neg
After UPS destroyed a Whirlpool unit last week, I opted to upgrade to this GE model.  The mistake I made was allowing UPS to handle the shipment again.  It is becoming apparent that UPS cannot handle anything that requires a hand truck without damaging it.  I would suggest that Amazon include a carrier option for shipping heavy items to possibly preclude damage in shipment.  For me, UPS would fall just below the kid down the street with his little red wagon.  As to the GE microwave, it arrived with two corners completely bashed in and assorted other small dents.  Not exactly a 30,000 foot drop, but enough to render it unusable.  If I'm ever able to once again enjoy receiving, installing and using an over-the-range microwave oven, I'll be sure to review its salient points.  Oh, and all potential buyers should be aware that if you purchase any item like this from a vender who does not have the caveat fulfilled by Amazon next to their name,and you have to return the item, you will simply have to wait for the item to arrive back at the vender and then rely on the vender to reimburse the cost.  Amazon cannot reimburse for it - you MUST wait for the vender.  Me?  I'm still waiting for my $500. Caveat Emptor!<br />September 13 - Update - Item arrived back at the vender today.  I'm still waiting for my $500.|neg
The microwave is light on features but works very well for the functions it provides.  It's a very simple micowave that does it's core job well which is exactly what I wanted.  I didn't need all of the advanced features, cooking presets and auto-options that the more expensive microwaves come with.  I installed the microwave in a couple hours removing the old one that didn't work anymore and had a bag of popcorn right after...|pos
i had where and tear on the bottom of my unit and paint pealing on the top. i brushes it down with a wire brush and put several coats of paint on it as directed. the product worked great. the inside of my microwave looks brand new.|pos
We used this brand new microwave for 3 weeks, and last night it caught fire while we were microwaving food.<br /><br />The food was not burnt, or overcooked. In fact it still had a minute more to go, when I noticed flames inside, at the top fan assembly region. We were able to put it out with a damp towel, but the entire top section was melted to reveal the electrical wiring inside.<br /><br />We googled to see if anyone had a similar problem and found the review posted just a week earlier hear on Amazon. This is clearly not some random freak accident, but a recurring problem with this microwave.<br /><br />If you have this microwave, do not leave it unattended while microwaving. If you are considering purchasing it, please please do not do it.|neg
waiting on the call to ge to tell what happened<br /><br />just sad that my 3rd microwave work for about 2 years on average|neg
As advertised.  Easy to replace, Not really much more to say, bought a replacement part and it worked. Saved the money for a new microwave.|pos
Add us to the long list of dissatisfied customers.  We already replaced the board once, and now, a year later, it went out again, suddenly, for no specific reason.  We heated up a bowl of chowmein for seven minutes. . . whoopee.  It's amazing that Samsung would not recall these microwaves or at least make the replacement part reasonably priced, but it's not worth buying the part, even to replace it yourself.  If you choose to purchase this microwave, do so with plans to throw it away in a year or so.<br /><br />Also, be aware that you have to specifically insist to the rep that you heard about the special one time repair that Samsung is supposedly doing, because they are not doing it on OUR models, only specific ones.|neg
I must prequalify this review with the statement of fact that we have 4 major Samsung appliances or electronic devices in our home. I have always liked Samsung.<br /><br />Bought and installed this microwave in January of 2012. It just died two days ago. Totally dead... no functionality whatsoever. No lights, no keypad, nothing but dull, silent, insolent non-function. It isn't my circuit, as my oven (also Samsung) shares the outlet and is working fine.<br /><br />I called Samsung, and since it is just out of warranty, the service call would be $125 just to look at it + parts and labor. On top of that, the first call would be the diagnosis, and the technician would not have the parts. They would have to reschedule for that.<br /><br />Since I have a toddler in the house, not having a microwave is out of the question. So the risk of a $200-$250 repair bill + 2 weeks of being out of commission basically means I have to go buy a new *&#!$ microwave.<br /><br />Argh. So irritating. DO NOT BUY.|neg
This microwave came with my apartment (mine is model JVM1540DM4WW, but it looks identical to this one), and it totally blew away my expectations of what a good microwave should be. It cooks quickly and evenly (everything takes about half as long as it did in my old microwave), the button options are good (I use the Express Cook buttons all the time), the bright and dim surface light options are nice, the shelf inside is pretty cool (even though I never cook that much at once), and I think it looks great in the kitchen (the rest of the kitchen is wonderful white and metal IKEAness). It's gotten a lot of use over the past year, and it's still performing just like new. I was surprised to see the negative reviews here, as I would absolutely buy another one of these.|pos
GREAT SMALL SIZE, looks good, fits in a corner and does not take up a lot of apace, and works very well.|pos
have owned Sharps in past.  this fit perfectly above stove. No alterations, no fuss , Works great. looks great. would recomend|pos
I love it!  I have a small kitchen with limited counter space and this little microwave is exactly what I needed.  It works as well as any other microwave I have owned.  Very happy!|pos
Unit arrived looking like a truck had run over it! Ordered again thru one of the big box hardware chains and it also arrived beat to heck. They say third time is a charm. We'll see...|neg
We just purchased a brand new home towards the end of April 2013 which had this microwave installed. There was no power in the house until we purchased it and we have already had the SE error code twice now. Even though the item was never used prior to April it is considered out of warranty because it was purchased in 2011. One of the reasons we picked this house was because of the brand new appliances. Samsung really blew it on this one. When we finally get the $$$ to replace this it will be with Frigidaire.  At least those still work in my home...|neg
I receive so many compliments about this cutie in our second kitchen. We have little counterspace in the area and this is worth every penny, works great, and a spectacular space saver. Highly recommended.|pos
Similar to many other reviewers, we were happy with our purchase until the SE error appeared. The microwave lasted for 3 years without a problem, but suddenly tonight while using the stove, the microwave gave the error message. We tried to troubleshoot the problem, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I called Samsung to report the problem, and they are sending out someone to repair the control panel free of charge. Because of the negative reviews, they do have a special warranty on this part of the unit since it is such a common problem. Despite their helpful customer service, I would not purchase this Samsung microwave unless you eventually want to have to replace a faulty control panel.|neg
Don't Buy!!!!  Our old version of the GE Profile caught fire while heating up something.  Fortunately our 8 yr. old son was in the room and was able to get my husband's attention before it escalated.  However, while trying to replace our microwave, we found that the only item we could replace it with was a GE microwave, either the Profile (which is the downgraded version of our former product) or a GE Monogram (the exact same unit as our old profile with a different name and much higher pricetag).  GE's response was to replace the item with the lower level model Profile (which we originally tried to replace it with but was falling apart after a couple of uses).  In order to get the exact same microwave (now called the Monogram) we had to pay an additional $335 for the upgrade.  Getting the microwave delivered in a timely and convenient fashion was another debacle.  Sadly, we are stuck using this GE product because our cabinets were built around the original, and nothing else will fit.|neg
I chose this microwave to go along with the GE Cafe range I purchased at the same time. I read multiple poor reviews of this microwave online, but decided to risk it because I wanted the microwave to match the range. Bad choice! After owning the microwave just over a year, the magnetron konked out. Luckily, that particular part was covered under a 5-year warranty, but I still paid nearly $200 for labor. Now, just a couple of years later, the touchpad has expired and will need to be replaced. The service department tells me this repair will be a minimum of $250. (Touchpads start at $150.)<br /><br />I have never had so many problems with an appliance. The refrigerator I bought at the same time has never required service. The washer and dryer I bought nearly ten years earlier have only once required service. Yet this microwave has required two expensive repairs within just a few years of purchase. Before I bought this GE Cafe microwave, I had a cheap, unremarkable countertop model. I don't even remember the brand. But it was still working when I upgraded to the GE Cafe, so even though it was nearly 20 years old I was able to pass it on it to a neighbor whose child was starting college. At this point, I wish I'd kept the old one! I will never buy GE Cafe again.|neg
We purchased this microwave, and then realized that 2 cu ft. is WAY too big for a family of three. We hoped to exchange it for a smaller one.<br /><br />Sharp told us that we were responsible for shipping (fair enough), but also that we would have to pay a 30% restocking fee.<br /><br />This is absurd. Who's ever heard of a 30% restocking fee? We never even removed this from the cardboard box- we simply opened the top, and then re-closed it. 30% seems like usury to me. Frankly, I can't believe Amazon would allow a merchant to charge a 30% restocking fee. I'm positive their Cost of Goods Sold isn't much more than 30%... what are they doing, just trashing returns?<br /><br />Anyway, even if I were going to buy a Sharp microwave again, I certainly wouldn't buy it HERE, and reward these unfair business practices.<br /><br />We own a business, and we expect to be treated as consumers, the same way we treat our customers.. that simply isn't happening here.|neg
Fits very nicely in a corner spot and doesn't take up much room which is nice when you do not have much counterspace|pos
My Samsung microwave worked fine until recently. It beeps!  It even starts beeping in the middle of the night.  I've unplugged and reset clock several times.  Now I have to unplug it after every use, and reset to use again.  Samsung online representative says if resetting doesn't work he would send a serviceman.  That would probably cost more than a new microwave.  I'll be searching for an new one.......definitely NOT a Samsung!|neg
this was exactly the one I needed I wasn't sure I would be able to find the one I needed but I did and loved the fact I received it sooner than expected|pos
fits in the corner under upper cabinets perfectly. Only 750 watts, but just fine for reheating left overs, etc.  I like that the &#34;controls&#34; are under the door, so that the turntable sits a little higher.  Also, something sitting in front of the microwave does not have to be moved before opening the microwave, as the door opens a few inches above the counter top.  I have only had the microwave for a month, but no problems at all.  I am very happy with my purchase.|pos
While redoing our kitchen, I discovered this microwave and I love it!  I was concerned about lack of a turntable but after a month of use, I have founds foods to be heated evenly.  The popcorn button works great and I love how easy it is to program things like defrost, melt butter, warm syrup, beverages, etc...  Most of all, I am thrilled to have the microwave off the counter and the drawer style is a must when mounting in a base cabinet.|pos
We bought GE Cafe appliances for our remodel and have had nothing but problems.  Out of 4 separate kitchen appliances, 3 have had problems within 2 to 3 years of ownership.  The GE Cafe microwave suddenly stopped heating and we had to have a repairman come replace the magnetron and diode.  It worked a few weeks but stopped working again.  Then we found out it costs more to repair than to buy a new one.  We traced a workaround to the problem ourselves and found that the microwave works as long as we turn on the stove exhaust fan.  So now, every time we use our microwave, you need to turn on the exhaust fan.  Nice!  Numerous other reviews have complained about the keypad burning out as well, so if you buy, make sure to buy a long term multi-year warranty.  Our GE failures happened shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, and parts/labor for most repairs adds up to the purchase of a new appliance.|neg
We gave this to my daughter for her birthday.  Her husband installed it over their range.  She loves the convenience of both another oven and the option of a microwave. the convection is large enough for a big baked chicken.|pos
We were reluctant to spend so much on a microwave as we are not big microwave users but we absolutely love this and are glad we splurged. It defrosts without cooking, won't burn popcorn, can soften butter without melting, and of course looks amazing. Its easy to clean and was pretty easy to install.  If I had to come up with a shortfall there is a height limit so forget tall items like those rice express packages.  Still worth it and would still recommend it.|pos
I got this microwave yesterday and I've been smiling about it ever since. I just love how it looks in the corner of my kitchen. The only negative to me is that it's kind of expensive for a small microwave, but what was the last thing you bought for your kitchen that just made you happy? Since the only con I can think of is the price, I'll just run through the pros as I see them.<br />1. It's unique. Every other microwave I've ever seen (with the exception of the Sharp Half-Pint) looks pretty much the same: a horizontal rectangle with a door and a keypad control panel to the right. The bottom controls and lack of numeric pad make this thing look entirely different, and in a good way. (Don't worry about the lack of a keypad, the controls are a no-brainer.) When you unbox it and see the rounded back, you know you've bought something different from the norm.<br />2. It's big inside. Bigger than my old GE compact for round things, and I've just never had the urge to throw a 9x13 pan in my microwave. (I have yet to try it with popcorn, manual says limit it to the 1.75 ounce size.)<br />3. It's powerful. 1:30 on high heats up a cup of water better than my old one. Good enough for me.<br />4. The LED display is blue. Very cool, in my opinion.<br />5. The interior light goes on when you open the door. Some small microwaves only light up while you're cooking.<br />6. You can use the timer and cook simultaneously. Pretty standard, but some don't. Also, you can adjust the timer and the cook time on the fly by hitting + or -, no need to stop and reset. And you can toggle between the timer and the clock if you want.<br />7. No door release button. You just grab the recessed edge of the door and pull. And it feels solid when you shut it.<br />8. The reminder tone shuts off. Yes, it reminds you when you forget to pull something out, but it shuts up after three reminders and reverts to the clock. (I swear my old microwave displayed End most of the time.)<br />9. Limited features.The only special features are defrost, reheat, popcorn, and power level (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and the power-saving 0%). I've never used anything more.<br />10. I'm running out of ideas, but to make a nice round 10, I'll point out that the door is about two inches thick with a space between an inner and outer window. This gives it a kind of window-box look that I like a lot.<br />Hope this helps convince everybody to pull the trigger and buy this microwave. You won't regret it!<br />NOTE: The display panel comes covered in a clear plastic film that is pretty easy to miss when you're unpacking. I didn't see it and was highly alarmed after a couple of days when the start button started to look and feel cracked! Further investigation revealed the protective film, which easily peeled off to reveal a pristine panel underneath.|pos
My husband and I purchased this on 5/27/13 .... the product has never worked.  I have been calling samsung for weeks and still the product doesn't work. Samsung has the worst customer service I have ever delt with. I am just trying to get a refund at this point.  I ask that they come and get it because,  I already paid to have it installed. ... I don't think I should have to pay to have taken out too. They said they will not send anyone and if I want a refund I have to send the plug and serial number . Again... just come and get it. Product is bad but the company is awful.  BBB rating for samsung appliances is an F wish I knew that before|neg
I have a General Electric microwave model PEM31SM4SS manufactured November of 2011 in Maylasia and it is peeling on the interior across the rear top. I replaced the previous unit because of the same problem.  It also was relatively new at the time.  About two years. Painting seems to be the option offered for repair. Maybe General Electric should include a can of paint and brush with their microwave ovens. I will purchase a new one this week but not GE|neg
At first we loved this microwave drawer and it seemed to do the core job of heating food just fine.  Then just over a year after the purchase date (when the builder bought all the appliances) the unit died.  No signs of life at all.  It had been in use for 3-4 months in total.  Microwaves have been around for a long time and most are pretty much bulletproof.  Not this one.  Reading the reviews it is obvious that Sharp has built a flawed product and is not standing behind it.  I have called them twice and asked about a product recall, and if they were going to escalate the product defect issues to their development team.  No response.  It's obvious that their customer service teams do not close the loop and provide feedback to their engineering and business teams.  For this price, this is an unbelievable rip off.  Yes it looks great, but it doesn't work much more than a year.  Now we're stuck, with the prospect of paying for service, and then waiting until it breaks again.  Since this is likely a low volume unit, the number of consumer complaints won't be adequate to force Sharp to own up to the obvious quality issues.|neg
Many more features than advertised. Reading the manual is highly advised to get the most out of this product. It even has an automatic fan function for over a range use if there's too much heat buid up.|pos
Great little microwave. It's the perfect size. It's a little underpowered, so a add 30 secs to most cooking times.<br />Small footprint and looks great in the kitchen.|pos
I got this to save counterspace and the fact I only use the microwave for reheating small meals and popcorn.  It performs these functions perfectly.  It may not have the most power but if another 30-60 seconds of reheating time is going to throw your day off, you have bigger problems than this microwave.|pos
I needed a smaller sized microwave to fit on my kitchen counter top, and I couldn't find anything smaller than a 0.7 Cu. Ft. in any store.  Since this one had so many good reviews, I decided to give it a try.  It not only fits perfectly on my tiny kitchen counter, but it is also the best microwave I've ever owned.  It fits regular sized dinner plates so it's the perfect size, and it heats up very quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone especially if you have a small kitchen.|pos
We purchased this microwave in Oct 2011 and it stopped heating in June 2013.  The defective part is the magnetron.  The magnetron has a 5 year warranty but it will cost $90 and 3 days for GE to come to my home to confirm that is the problem.  Then I am told I can expect to pay another $250-$300 for the labor for them to come back out and replace the magnetron, no idea how long that will take.  Fighting with GE at the moment to have the part shipped to my local repair man who said he would replace for $99 total.  Warranty information does not say anything about it having to be replace by a GE tech.<br /><br />We bought all new GE appliances in October 2011 and so far we have had to have the fridge and now the microwave repaired in the first 2 years.  I guess we still have the range and dishwasher to look forward to fixing.<br />I thought GE was a good company but experience has cleared things up.|neg
Started making a buzzing / arcing sound this morning.  Opened door, smelled burning electronics, unplugged for 30 minutes, tried again with nothing inside, same result.  Dead, going to recycling.  Getting a Panasonic Commercial Grade microwave instead - all residential microwaves seem to have reliability issues.|neg
We bought all new Samsung appliance for our new home. The microwave and refrigerator have had to be repaired. The microwave started leaking microwaves and burned the inside lip of the unit and on the inside of the door, burning the paint. Samsung replaced the unit after it was seen by an appliance repairman and photos were uploaded to them. My replacement unit just died for no reason. I checked the outlet, breaker and plug - all fine. I have to wait another week before the appliance repairman can come out and tell me I'll have to wait another 2 weeks for a new unit to arrive. Then, I'll have to pay for it to be installed again.|neg
Perfect fit for a tiny counter space. Looks great and does small reheats well. Interior space is not huge but fits a dinner plate snugly|pos
Although I did not buy this microwave on line, I feel the need to warn potential buyers.  Caveat Emptor.<br />Unless you really like loud appliances, do not buy this one.  It sounds like a jet about to take off. I expected it to sound like a normal microwave. Not, a 747. One may think I am making a mountain out of a molehill, but I am hard of hearing and it is still loud to me.  I can only imagine what it sounds like to one with normal hearing.  'Nuff said.|neg
This little microwave fits into the corner.  We have limited counter space and switching to this mircrowave give us back so much room without losing the convenience.  If you cook in your microwave it won't hold a 9x12 baker, so keep that in mind when deciding.|pos
This is perfect for one plate! It nice to have a microwave big enough to cook a turkey, but honesty, who ever cooked a turkey in a microwave? This is perfect and the round design means it fits a plate in a very small space! I got one for my mom, too, and she loves it! She finally threw out her old huge microwave and reclaimed counter space! My only wish would be that it was a full 1000 watts (it's 750) just so it would match the cook times on most microwave meals and recipes.|pos
I did not buy this here but from the store with the blue shirt associates; my model is SMH9187, which is similar to this one. This was installed by my contractor during a complete kitchen remodel and looked great above the Samsung range. After about 2 years, I got what all those 1-star raters got, a sudden incessant beeping that you could not reset or turn off, other than through unplugging the appliance. I tried turning off the main power, etc. but nothing worked; in fact, the error message and beeping became continuous.<br /><br />Friends of mine have had the same model for over three years and they have not had this problem. Why? Because I cook a lot of steamed food (rice, pasta, vegetables) and they do not. I'm sure the heat and steam from the range top has, as others have noted, damaged the circuit board. The keypad is over the right back burner, and even if I use any of the front burners, the steam will cover the entire front of the microwave; this happens even with the fan at full blast. There is always a film of condensation over the bottom half of the microwave.|neg
We purchased and installed the drawer oven in August 2010, while doing a remodel in our kitchen.  It was a more expensive option, but it fit perfectly in a location between our fridge and sink area, and maintained the contour of the kitchen we were seeking.  We use it at least two or three times a day, and have been very pleased with its performance, and we have not had any problems with it.  It does not have a turntable; however, our experience is it does the job just as well.  It is easy to get to and easy to clean.  It does not have a huge interior, so if you have plans to microwave tall items, check the dimensions first so that you are not surprised by that.  Overall, we have found it to be a very nice addition to our kitchen, and would purchase one again.|pos
It worked great at home. But we got it for our truck. But our 1500 watt inverter can't run it. So it fit great in the freightliner truck. But u gotta have a bigger inverter.|pos
I loved the small size of this microwave, but the power was lacking. Furthermore, after we had this unit for 1 month, it would not cook anything longer than 2 minutes. The light would remain on and the turntable would continue to spin, but the motor would just shut off and cease cooking. We returned this product.|neg
We bought this microwave cause it matched the GE Profile Range we had purchased previously.  It looks great!<br />However, after less than 2 months of use, we had to replace the over the range light bulbs; which is apparently a common issue from the reviews on the ge website.  Worked fine for a year after that.  Last week we had an issue where the microwave started beeping to notify us that there was an issue with the keypad.  Turning the power saver off and on cleared the message, and we continued to use it uninterrupted for another week; until yesterday.  After heating lunch, I tried to warm a bottle of milk in this microwave.  After 30 seconds it was still cold, so I tried again.  At that point the microwave filled with smoke and the kitchen started to smell like something was burning.  We were told by the sales guy at the store that it is the magnatron that went (which is covered under warranty, but the labor is not; not to mention the $99 just to have the GE repair guy come to my house.  It sounds like something I wouldn't trust to be repaired.<br />I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!|neg
This is the perfect sized microwave for my kitchen. The domed shape works great on my smaller counter top. Would recommend it!|pos
I have benn using this mivrowave for about a month now and it is great. It is easy  to use and powerful when cooking a microwave meal and the packing tell you to put in in for 3 min. and 30 sconds. your meal will come out nice and hot. this microwave is munch beatter then the lg one I had. any one looking for a good microwave should look in to this one. Don't belive the bad reviews. because I have had this microwave for a month now and I have Had no problems with it. I got my microwave from home depot.|pos
Love that it is off the counter, large, and works well.  I originally bought this microwave 6 years ago with absolutely no problems.  An electric failure in the house caused us to have to replace it, and without question, we bought the same one.|pos
I have owned this Microwave for 2 years and have NEVER had a problem with it.I use it daily for cooking and warming food. I would buy this same unit again. It works great.I don't understand all the bad reviews?This Sharp was a good product.I don't understand where people say it has a loud noise while it runs? I have had a few different microwaves and the motor sounds alike on every unit I had.My sharp sits on my counter near the stove and it has a really nice appearence to it.I am very Happy with this Sharp Microwave.|pos
I bought this GE microwave yesterday -- but not from Amazon, from Best Buy (only because I needed it right away). I unpacked the box and set it up. It would not work at all -- the display continually says Door (despite multiple clearing steps, resets, unplug/plug in, etc.). This display error message is not even addressed in the manual. I spent 30 minutes of my first day of ownership on the phone with GE support. The answer from them was obvious -- sorry, the door safety switch must not work properly. They gave all the usual excuses, sorry-sorry-sorry, please arrange for us to service it or repack it and drive it back to the store. Nice job GE -- an American name product and customer service at its finest, and you wonder why people buy alternative Asian name products. Best Buy should stop stocking GE products if this is GE's idea of quality control. Don't they check that products work when switched on before final packaging? I should not have to drive all the way back to the store. GE is wasting my time.<br /><br />Even more interesting -- I gave a negative one-star review of the microwave on the GE customer review section -- and their verification department that controls what is said on their website about their products, rejected my commentary. They have, however, allowed 14 reviews ranging from 3 to 5 stars. Here is the text of their rejection email to me:<br /><br />We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on JES0736SPSS; however, your review did not meet the guidelines for posting on our site.<br />We encourage you to revisit our guidelines and resubmit your review on JES0736SPSS<br /><br />I then read the GE guidelines, and NOTHING in my submission contravened the commentary guidelines -- it just happens to be a one star review from a very unhappy customer. GE does not like criticism. This experience has further reaching effects -- I am also looking at buying a new high end kitchen refrigerator -- GE was on my list, but no longer.|neg
A similar model that we got when we bought our home 6 years ago died and we needed the exact sized model to replace it because the old model was built into a non-adjustable shelve/frame above the counter top.  Searched websites and found what I wanted.  then searched Amazon and found one with the best price (@ Abe's of Maine)!  Quick delivery and the packaging/crating was extraordinary.  Would buy product again, and would buy from Abe's of Maine again!|pos
I bought this microwave for my first apartment which has extremely limited counter space.  This tucks nicely in the corner that typically isn't usable space and allows me to still have enough room on the counter for food prep.  It heats food very evenly and fits a full sized dinner plate in it.  Even if I eventually move into a place with a larger kitchen, I'd likely keep this microwave since it works so well.|pos
I needed a little oven that fit in the corner.  For size and convenience it works well.  I have found that I need to leave what ever I am cooking in the oven a little bit longer.  But it works well and no complaints about operation.|pos
Fits perfectly in our countertop CORNER.  Fits in the &#34;dead space&#34; there.<br />It's on the small side, but it is perfect for our needs.|pos
I have a tiny kitchen and was replacing an over the range microwave. I was looking for a space saver microwave, and I found it. It is large enough to handle anything my old microwave could do like day to day tasks of reheating, baking potatoes, and other small food items.|pos
Exactly what I wanted! It's the perfect fit. Works just fine... Bye bye bulky hand me down... I'm handing you down, lol|pos
We purchased our Samsung MW (SMH9187W)three years ago.  It now has an SE error.  As others reported, Samsung told us to flip the breaker switch, etc., but a few minutes later, the same SE message came up, along with incessant beeping. Called Samsung back and we were passed around for about half an hour.  Called Lowe's (where we bought it) - said it would probably cost $150 to fix it and it should have lasted five years.  To us, not worth fixing.  Will NEVER buy another Samsung appliance.|neg
Just installed the microwave and it has a lot of options. Just getting used to it. Unit did arrive with 2 minor dents to the exterior cabinet. Didn't return item because damage was hidden by install and didn't effect the operation of the unit. I was kind of wary that it would arrive damaged due to the weight of the item.I would recommend this item.|pos
It met all my needs regarding space, looks like a TV, works well and you don't need a college degree to operate. Very pleased with this products. Little pricey but worth it.|pos
I had a rust spot inside my microwave oven.  Sanded it down, put on two coats of paint, fixed the problem and the rust hasn't come back.|pos
I like this microwave, it is small and uses very little space in my small kitchen, but it is powerful. It is a good combination of quality and good design. Expensive but worth it|pos
I bought this LG microwave (LMV1680ST) as part of a full kitchen remodel a year ago. Upon first use, the microwave sparked and then made an unusually loud humming when on. Nothing heated. It broke on the first use. Home Depot, of course, said LG had to come out to deal with it. Since it was installed and not something I could easily take back to the store, I had to contact LG and schedule first a service consultation and THEN a service. What a pain. Now, less than a year later, the microwave is broken again. Since I bought it a few months before installation it's now out of warranty and LG wants to charge me $150 just to come out and inspect it. Don't buy it!! I threw away $200 on it and will just have to replace aNd pay for ANOTHER installation.|neg
We never had the SE error but at 16 months the microwave, sparked, growled, then smoked like crazy out of the top.  It is now DOA and out of warranty.|neg
Looks great, works great. Took less than an hour to install. Was a little overwhelmed with instructions, but was easier to install than originally thought. Looks great in my kitchen and has opened up so much space in my small kitchen. I would recommend this product to anyone!|pos
It's rather small on the outside, and just big enough on the inside.  Everyone who comes over thinks it's a TV.|pos
Was great until I opened the door and the microwave inlet cover is (what???) CARDBOARD (???) which I touched and it bent and now am reluctant to use to microwave.  Waiting for Whirlpool to answer my questions about this cardboard affecting my food.  They said not to remove it.  Wondering if anyone has any comments about this.|neg
Very good product quality, this is all I expected to get.<br />I recommend to other buyers those are thinking to buy that.|pos
From the moment I took it out of the box, it looked beautiful, fit perfect in my small newly remodeled kitchen and works great! I put some money into my new kitchen with a very nice looking back splash in tile and glass. I did not want my old LARGE white microwave oven taking up one entire wall. I don't use the microwave that much, so this is perfect.  It's not all that powerful but if you are buying something to heat things up or make popcorn AND you want style and beauty - this is it!|pos
I purchased this microwave and and a more expensive model ($200+) from Williams-Sonomo and this Whirlpool is a much better machine. The build quality is excellent and the veritcal-ness of it saves space on the counter. Had to return the Williams-Sonoma model.  The Whirlpool is perfect for heating plates of food and leftovers in medium size bowls.<br />At first, I missed the numeric key pad on my old over the stove model but the small size of this models doesn't allow for the large pad. However,, after a short time you get used to pressing the start button to add time in increments of 30 seconds. Super product that I would buy again and it looks cool.|pos
Worse product I've ever owned, I purchased the older model JVM17501MM on 06/29/2011 and it completely failed on 03/3132013, GE serviceman came to my home on 04/05/2013 and gave me a discounted (50% p&l) repair bill of $240.00. My consumer advocate at GE offered me a replacement of $250.00, funny since this item is selling all over for under $200.00. I will NEVER purchase any product from GE AGAIN. You should stay away. RUN away from this.|neg
We love this microwave. It looks great and has given us a lot more space in the corner where nothing but the old clunky microwave was. Our kitchen looks so much more modern and the microwave itself fits everything (including our largest dinner plates). Heating will require an additional 20-30 seconds but definitely worth the wait!!! Can't say enough about how cool it looks!|pos
I have had the same problems as the others who wrote on here. I had a white over the range GE microwave that started having keypad problems. Since I was upgrading to stainless appliances, I bought this one and after 3 yrs. started having problems with the keypad again. Some of the buttons stopped working, then one night I woke up to a beeping sound and on the microwave display it said service immediately. I will not buy another GE appliance again, I would like to know what brand is a good one to go with.|neg
None available.|neg
My mom bought this for us about a month ago and it's been a real pleasure having it in our kitchen. There are no extraneous buttons, just tap the START button for 30 second intervals. Everything cooks evenly and quickly plus it's small so it sits in the corner and looks like an old school tv.  I recommend this for anyone that just uses a microwave to reheat and cook smaller frozen food meals.|pos
I like the looks, the operation buttons on the bottom lends itself to a user friendly and a highly visible control panel. We have multiple Samsung products. All exceed our expectations of their products<br />There are NO other microwaves on the market with bottom eye level control buttons|pos
Had to replace 5 microwaves in 5 years - 2 GE and 3 Samsung microwaves that cost much more died premature deaths at my house, vacation condo, and GF's house. Bought 2 of these so far and the first outlasted the 5. Hope to have the same luck with this one.|pos
Easy to install, user friendly instructions.  Came in good condition.  Manual very easy to understand and use micro/oven.  Cooks in 1/2 the time when using fast back.  Really good product.|pos
Bought this at Christmas time to replace a GE Conv/Micro that cost $1200. This is the slickest microwave you could imagine. Works great and heats faster than the old GE; that cost 5 times more. If you want a SS Microwave, to go over your stove, and dont want to break the bank, I couldnt say enough about this one. It works flawlessly, and performs with the best of them.<br />With that said, I was very disapointed with the limited manual that comes with it, and owned it for a month, before I realized that that 99% of the info, that I was looking for, is on a label INSIDE THE DOOR JAM ?????????????????? There is NO MENTION of that fact in the manual; And all the codes, and info, I was searching for is printed right there on the bottom of the door jam; IF you know where to look for it!! So in closing this is a run to buy it purchase; and you will not be disapointed in the unit in anyway . Read all the codes inside the doorjam on the bottom and life will be good for you !!!!<br />Excellent plus on this unit.|pos
Love this microwave. Product was Easy to install, and easier to operate. The first one we ordered came damaged. The process to return item was a piece of cake. The second one came (from a different company) and was packaged much much better. We used to have our microwave sitting on the counter. We remodeled our 1950 galley kitchen and only had room for a drawer microwave. We will NEVER go back to any other microwave. Well worth the price..<br />Love, Love , Love this product|pos
This microwave is now two years old and the door has too much play in it. It is loose and jiggles. The repairman can't fix it. It appears it needs a spacer of some sort. I would not recommend this product for that reason. If the door starts to do this, you have to get a new microwave.|neg
This was the perfect microwave for my kitchen remodel.It is quite roomy. I particularly like the two stage fan and lighting features.|pos
I had it for about a year and a half now when the door is closed it just runs without producing heat.  I guess I could get it repaired but I'm wondering if it's worth it.  I may just buy a better quality microwave so I don't have to deal with it again.|neg
None available.|neg
Install went well but retrofiting the exterior vent was a chore but thats not a problem of the unit. Only had it up and going for a short while but so far so good.|pos
this is the best Microwave I have ever had.  Love the size and the program buttons.are so nice.<br /><br />I use the Bake Potato button all the time.|pos
Thirty inch wide microwave ovens are a little hard to find. But that was the only thing I could use in the cabinetry in our Winnebago RV. It's much quieter than the one it replaced and seems to be more powerful too. We like it's added features oer the older unit we had. It decided to only run on high.|pos
I went to open my microwave and the handle snapped ...yup snapped off into pieces!  Frigidaire will so graciously allow me to buy a new one as their way of standing behind their product....yes so we purchase an expensive microwave that is made so cheaply that you have to replace the handle that breaks apart and they get more money-yes that does sound right doesn't it?  But they stand behind their products....So frustrating!  Unless you have money to burn on replacing parts-DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!|neg
Whirlpool,<br /><br />Check out these reviews!!  Obviously there is a serious defect.  Although it sounds like ours lasted longer than most (24 months).  Like others have written, we are not very heavy microwave users....the occassional reheating of coffee or defrosting of meat.  Seems ridiculous to me!|neg
Had this for about 5 years now after a Panasonic NN-H965WF failed within 19 months of being purchased new. No repairs necessary with this Sharp microwave, and the sensor still works great. Use that function and you'll almost never have to worry about underheated food.|pos
As described by Phil, it is very easy to install.  A tip, as you cut the 4 small taps to get to the motor, put a small tool or wire in the door hole to keep in from falling inside the unit.  After you install the new motor, flip the door you cut out over, and the tab neatly fits the loop and the small screw hole lines up.  Use a small screw to attach the cut out door and it will be sealed from dust and dirt, as well as easily accessible if you ever need to open again.|pos
I purchased this unit to replace a GE spacemaker because it was the only one I could find that would fit in the cabinet space.  The new unit would not heat food when it arrived.  I am requesting an immediate replacement from the supplier.  I recall when GE had a good reputation in appliances, but now I have a low opinion of their quality.|neg
I currently have one of these that fits perfectly in the space I have.  Bought this one again as a spare.  Just in case... and we know that case will come at the most inconvenient time.  Very happy with this 800W model.  Does my jobs.<br />  It is pretty good for my 1964 vintage wired house.  Too many things plugged in and too many watts required at the same time makes for too many trips to the fuse box.|pos
Man I wish I'd read these reviews before buying this. I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!|neg
Just like everyone else, I own this microwave. it died after 1yr of normal use right after the warranty ran out. When it worked there were no issues.|neg
Has been owned for less than a year.. started sparking and had to stop using.  Now shopping for a new one.|neg
This microwave came with my new home and overall, I am very pleased with it. It is sturdily-built and has an attractive stainless steel finish and design. It does a great job at heating up and cooking food, and even though it may not have all of the features of a more expensive microwave, the features it does have, work well. I particularly like the turntable and the add 30 seconds button. The only downside I can think of is that it does not have the express 1 minute, 2 minute, etc. buttons. When it comes to a microwave, simplicity in use is key and this one definitely fits the bill.|pos
The Motor fit perfect, works great, price was excellent.<br />Was much cheaper than new microwave A A A A plus|pos
All purchase and shipping activities were fine. Microwave door on this model not well designed. It sticks and won't open or close properly if the unit is not perfectly level meaning installation under cabinet must be virtually perfect. Appliance repair person told me this is always a problem with this model. Wish I knew that before purchasing.|neg
Googled by the model number and brought me here to see what a piece of crap that Whirlpool have made.<br />This is suppose be the upgraded version that my builder put in, yet with hardly any usage, this thing crap out on me.<br />I am the 35th customer that's pissed off of owning this crap.<br /><br />It is amazing that Whirpool have the balls to sell this microwave at all.<br /><br />Never ever going to get anything from Whirpool ever again.|neg
This microwave worked fine while it lasted, about 2 years.  It looks fine and wasn't too loud when the fan was on, but the fact that it didn't last any longer makes the features irrelevant.  The price certainly was no better than comparable microwaves with much better longevity.  I would not recommend this product.|neg
This thing broke down in the same manner as all the other reviewers described. Samsung should be ashamed, this is a pretty obvious design flaw. I will be staying away from ALL samsung products from now on.|neg
I bought this for myself about 2 years age and liked it so much that I bought the same one for my sister. I like it very much. Its a perfect size, easy to use, has a button for baking potatoes and other items. I recommend it very highly.|pos
Bought this microwave in June 2012 for a kitchen remodel. Its barley 5 months old and although I have not experienced the dreaded 5E error, the unit has already started acting funny. The last few days the unit will loose the time and display please set time. This AM while making oat meal for my daughter, I opened the unit and it was dead. No light like it was unplugged. Closed and the display listed all 0's across. Opened door again no light. After a few times the light went on and unit was operational. Subsequently  I did do the stop/enter key diagnostic test and all it showed me was 1816s (model) and 110512A, which I assume means 1105watts 12amps? I hope this is not a precursor to the 5E error? Thinking the seller acquired refurbished units from another party (i.e.Samsung, Lowes?) and has been pawning them off as new here. I am going to check to see if my appliance repair plan that I pay for from my utility company will covers microwaves, if not new unit for me.|neg
Like other reviewers this is the 3rd GE Spacemaker microwave I have owned.  We also built the space to fit this model and it is difficult to find a replacement.  I kept hoping with each new model that GE had corrected the problem.  The paint is peeling of the ceiling of my current microwave less than 2 years later. I worry that the paint will get in the food or worse that there may be a danger at using it.|neg
I bought this microwave about a year ago.  The exterior is attractive, and it fit well into the space I had for it.  However, after just one year of relatively infrequent use, the top of the cavity is flaking, with big chunks of paint now gone. I've had to throw away things I've cooked because there were flecks of paint falling from the top into my dish. It is ridiculous to have to replace a new and otherwise functional appliance. The replacement will not be a GE.|neg
A very compact, beautiful and sleek microwave.  Saves a on counter space and will accommodate a full size dinner plate.|pos
Fits a cup of coffee, dinner plate and popcorn. What else do you need? Fits perfect in my cabinet out of site!|pos
This product fit and worked as expected. For anyone wondering about how to install, there is a pattern of holes drilled in the bottom of the microwave around the turntable motor. To get to the motor, gently cut the metal between the holes to create a little door. Open the door, remove 2 screws then the motor, unplug old motor, plug in new one, drop new motor into hole, put 2 screws back. You're probably supposed to throw the &#34;door&#34; away but I bent mine back in there. Flip microwave over and plug it in, put turntable spindle back on and try it out. I recommend doing this out of sight of your spousal unit, and then take about 30 minutes to goof off. Then return microwave to spousal unit telling them what an arduous task it was but how you figured it out and saved the family $100.00. Should be good for at least a hug or a kiss or WHATEVER...|pos
This microwave works well. I wanted a microwave to heat my rice filled heating pad for my shoulders. It does that and doesn't take up too much space on the counter. I am very pleased.|pos
Wouldn't work.  Have to return it.  The word 'door' keeps showing up as if there is a problem with the door.<br />There is no problem.|neg
Received it and installed it. The fan went on and the fan blew but it did not heat.  It took me two months to finally get a repair person to come out but he guessed and ordered the wrong part (magnitron). It turned out to be something else, I can't remember what, so they have to order that. I am still waiting.  Fortunately my old microwave (Amana) still works out in the garage or I would be really frustrated. The repair person told me that GE has the most problems even though all the brands use the same components, from Korea.  Must be something about the GE specs together that blows things up.  I'll be staying clear of GE products from now on.|neg
Microwave does it's job but door started sagging within first 30 days and the unit quit working within a year.|neg
We love this new appliance.  Just a few days before Thanksgiving our old one died.  I purchased a new one locally and after installation realized the door hinges are placed where we could not open the door more than a few inches.  Returned that one and went online and found this one at almost $100.00 less than what my local dealer could get it for me.  He agreed that I should order thru Amazon and not only did I receive it in less than a week, it fit, looks great and works perfectly!|pos
Simple to use, spacious, and compact. :)  Been looking for a microwave like this for a while.  The only drawback is it looks a bit like a old TV on the kitchen counter.|pos
This is the second microwave and just like the first one it lasted less then a year. The magnetron fried, we bought a new one, it fried again, we fixed it and it happened a 3rd time. I will not buy another whirlpool product!|neg
The microwave in our new house had corrosion and under the turntable. I sanded and cleaned for about an hour then sprayed this paint. I did have a little overspray but it turned out pretty well. There's a spot that looks like I didn't sand and clean well enough but there is plenty of paint left in the can to re-do it. It's good enough for now and the paint is holding up well after a month.|pos
I live in a small house (400 sf) so I don't have much room for anything. This may be too soon for a review (as I just received the microwave y'day) but so far it's just perfect. I love that the controls are on the bottom instead of on the side, as my microwave cubby is only 16.5 inches wide. I like the style and the easy setup, as well. It's perfect for an apartment, dorm room, or office kitchen.<br /><br />One thing to note - on the inside left wall (if you're facing the microwave), there's what looks like a cardboard panel screwed into the wall by the vent. There isn't anything definitive about what to do about this panel, and since it looks like it could possibly be removed, I called Whirlpool customer service to get some clarification. Long story short - don't remove the panel, it's supposed to be there.<br /><br />Other than that momentary confusion, I'm really happy with this product.|pos
We read all the negative reviews but decided to take a chance anyway as this was the only size microwave that fit the cabinet space we had. Big mistake. 1yr 2months after we bought it the magnetrom(?) stopped working - the microwave no longer heats anything. Called for service and since labor is out of warranty it would cost us $180 to get it fixed. Even before that some of the exterior plastic pieces had actually come off and we had just taped it back on.<br />Well, we're NOT buying another one of these nor getting it fixed. We've chosen to re-do the cabinet because in the long run it will be cheaper than to keep buying a poorly built product that lasts just past its 1 yr warranty. Will be staying away from GE products as well.|neg
This microwave is garbage.  We have had many problems with it, fought with the warrenty center, they finally replaced it and it is not working again. Microwave ovens should last longer than just a couple years.  Whirlpool you need to do something about this.  You know this isnt just a random problem.  You have produced a inferior product and you need to do something about it.  This microwave costs $1000.00.  This isnt a walmart throw away item.  YOU NEED TO RECALL THIS ITEM!|neg
There is definitely a manufacturing flaw with this microwave that Whirlpool refuses to admit! When this microwave was under warranty in the first year, we had if fixed FOUR times for the same problem. Luckily we didn't have to pay for those repairs because the warranty covered it. While it was still under warranty, we tried to talk to the company and let them know about the four repairs for the SAME thing noting that it must be a problem with how the product was made. All they did was try to get us to buy the extended warranty.<br /><br />So, 8 months after we bought this $500 microwave, we had to buy a new one! I truly believe that Whirlpool knows there is a defect with this microwave but refuses to stand behind their product.|neg
Item was what was advertised, in condition advertised and delivered on time. That's all you can ask of a supplier. You must prepare the area where you are going to use the paint. Takes a lot of sanding and preparing, but the result of spraying even coats is great.|pos
I bought this microwave almost a year ago. Love it. Quality is good enough ( I do not use it too often). I really in love with the design.|pos
This is a really nice little microwave!  Just what I was looking for.  No complaints.  It was shipped quickly by the supplier, too.  The controls are simple and elegant, and the surfaces are easy to clean.  I would buy it again.|pos
So far so good. Replaced a Samsung and the existing bracket worked. Much quieter than the one replaced. My wife loves the<br />melt/soften function.|pos
I bought this microwave August 2012. It died November. The operator's manual stated that, to avoid trip charges, I should take it GE Customer Care services and pick it up following service. Called up 1-800-GECARES, as given in the manual, to inquire on where to take it for service. There was no option to do that. They want to make a service call and charge $80 trip fee.<br /><br />Stay away from GE Products. They're defective and service is poor.|neg
I've been trying to get through to Whirlpool about this microwave, having the same issues as everyone else. I don't ever remembering seeing a product with all 1 star reviews; I don't know if it's even worth getting this fixed through warranty after reading all these. I won't be buying any Whirlpool from here on including any other brand names they use.|neg
Motors turn at the correct speed and are powerful enough to power my project of a miniature barber pole and the price was good.|pos
This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.  I'm out of $600 (or more) and  I'm left reheating stuff in the oven now.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE.|neg
This product sucks ass when I received it doesn't work and have tryed and tryed to exchange it but whirlpool does not and will not stand behind there products|neg
This is the second Sharp R-1405, Over the Range Microwave I have owned. The first one lasted 8 years and gave me excellent service. So I was thrilled when I found the same model still being produced. I snatched it up and easily installed it because the same install hardware was required and 90% of the mounting hardware was already installed in the wall above the stove. Not only that..The price was about $200 or $300 less than comparable over the range microwaves. An excellent product that gets the job done!!...I highly recommend it!|pos
Same story as the others here. Poor product, poor service. The dreaded -se- code after 20 months.  Debating smashing it on YouTube once I get a new microwave. Don't buy this rubbish!|neg
We loved the small size & appearance.  Unfortunately, it worked for the first 3 days, so we through away the box.  Before the week was over, it wouldn't heat anything no matter how long we set the timer for, or what power setting we used.  Without the box, it can't be returned. A complete waste of money.  DO NOT BUY THIS MICROWAVE, or if you feel like gambling, at least SAVE THE BOX!|neg
For some strange reason, my microwave turntable plate just cracked in half.  I didn't have a part number so went by brand and size and found the perfect replacement through an Amazon vendor.  The order was shipped quickly and our microwave is usable again.  We are very happy and would recommend the vendor and product.|pos
Wish I had checked Amazon before buying. As of today, not one review higher than 2 stars. I have to agree. Ours just crapped out shortly after the one-year warranty. Anyway,with most warranties, it's simpler to just buy a replacement rather than go through the hassle and expense of repair. It wouldn't be so bad if this was a countertop model, but when you have to install something, you don't want to drag it out and leave a gaping hole in your kitchen. I will avoid ANY Frigidaire appliance from now on.|neg
When the turntable on my Sharp microwave stopped turning, I went on line to find a substitute.  Some years ago I had a turntable that worked independently of the microwave.  Simple device.  Works by winding it up, much like an old fashioned alarm clock.<br /><br />After Googling turntable, I came upon this little motor and thought &#34;Why not?&#34;, I can do this.  I know nothing about electronics, so I realized that by taking the microwave apart to make the fix, I might destroy it, but it wasn't working anyway so I decided to gamble and order the part.<br /><br />I very carefully opened up the microwave (after disconnecting it from the power) and located the motor that turned the turntable.  It was simple (fairly intuitive) to remove and replace, and for a very small amount of money, I fixed the microwave.  I've had this microwave for seven plus years and now I expect to get another seven, very possibly more.<br /><br />Overall...  one of my best buys on Amazon.|pos
Haven't returned item because seem to be complicated return policy and not given clear answer on step. The actually ad is different than the actual product.|neg
Like most other reviews here, I can confirm that this microwave died quickly. After 2 weeks the handle broke off in my wifes hand. After 10 months we had a loose connection internally that needed to be repaired, and now after 16 months, the unit is completely dead. Fuses all check out fine. Thermal fuse, Thermocouple and power check out fine. All 120 volts. Either the control board for the keypad is dead, or the magnatron, HV capacitor or diode is shot. Either way, we are NOT repairing the unit again. It will be replaced with a commercial microwave and I will build a shelf for it to sit on over the top of our range. I will mount an exhaust fan below that and duct it all outside.<br /><br />This microwave has completely turned me off from the Samsung brand (which all of our appliances are). Too bad it's just cheap construction that ruins these new microwaves. They are all built with cheap components, unless you buy a commercial/industrial unit.<br /><br />Look at the Panasonic Pro series NE-1054, Vollrath 40830, Turbo Air TMW-1100M, or Amana RMS-10D for quality at a decent price. I wish they made a commercial over the range style, but I have yet to find one.|neg
Very attractive and functional microwave, that was easy to install as a replacement for a GE microwave that no longer worked.|pos
This microwave was pre installed by KB HOME when I purchased the house. It came with extended warranty for 18 months and the microwave died just after 20 month of use. I don't know how whirlpool manage to tune this microwave just to work for the warranty period.<br /><br />Anyway now I end up with an expensive exhaust :(<br /><br />Take it from all the reviewers here !!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !!!|neg
Purchased this microwave from Lowes in August 2011.  The microwave stopped heating four days ago...fifteen months from installation to failure.  Contacted Samsung for repair service, and was directed to an authorized service provider in my area who qouted me a $95 charge just to come to the house...parts and labor would be additional.  What's interesting is that the microwave didn't last long enough for me to experience the SE code problem that virtually everyone else has mentioned.  So, do I pay to have the unit repaired only to then have the SE code problem pop-up, or do I just go get a different oven???  Hmmmm...I think I'll get a new oven...and not a Samsung.|neg
Needed a new stainless steel microwave. Works well, nice and big. It is only stainless on the front, black everywhere else. Works well so far...|pos
This is an excellent product. It has variable intensity settings and just enough features to be easy to use. Its not only nice looking, but Consumer Reports rates it as one of the best. The stainless steal body makes it easy to clean and it fits any Kitchen decor.|pos
Had this microwave for only 18 month and the door latching spring broke.  Now I can't close the door, and nothing works.|neg
This microwave SUCKS and so does the seller!!!! I purchased this microwave in April because I was remodeling my kitchen and was upgrading to this better quality stainless steel over the range microwave.  Well how I said I purchased it in April, but didn't install it until the beginning of August.  The delivery was fast, but when I reccieved it, two of the back corners were dented, but I decided to install it anyways because it was in the back anyways and nobody would ever see it.  It is now October and it has gone out on me.  I was about to warm up my dinner when I pressed start and BOOM it went out.  It turned off just like that.  It never turned back on. I am really dissapointed becasue I thought I had purchased a good quality product.  I contacted the seller and he said to call Samsung and they would cover it since its still under warranty.  Well it is under warranty, but the thing is it turns out this is a refurbished unit when the seller says he purchased it new from Lowes.  He's a liar becasue Lowes does NOT sell refurbished units.  So now I'm out a couple hundred $$$ and now I have to purchase a new one.  People please listen to the reviews and don't buy this microwave, whether it's her or some other place.  Save yourselves time, money, and dissapointment.  Also, do NOT buy from this seller he is sooo unproffesional and NOT helpfull. I only give it one star because I have to give it a 1-5 or else I would give it a 0.|neg
This is the third model of this microwave I have bought.  Since I do a lot of cooking with my microwave, I enjoy all the features this one has:  particularly, the &#34;baked potato&#34; and &#34;sensor reheat&#34; functions.  Not only was I overjoyed to find the exact model, I saved over $70 on my replacement!  I was also pleasantly surprised when it arrived three days after my order!|pos
This was the Consumer Reports recommended one, and we bought one based on that, only to have it fail within 24 months.  I won't be wasting money on repairing this, and certainly won't be buying a Samsung brand.|neg
Evidently this is a common problem with Samsung microwaves: the keypad shorted out after less than two years of use, resulting in the microwave, stove light, and exhaust fan becoming inoperable.  The cost of repair- for labor only- would have been $150 for an item that originally cost $220.  After several calls to Samsung's Executive Customer Relations department, I was curtly informed that Samsung is unwilling to take ANY action to remedy this situation.  My only option at this point is to replace the microwave - NOT with a Samsung product- as I have no way of running the exhaust fan in my newly-remodeled kitchen. And even worse, due to some new environmental law, I will have to PAY to dispose of this worthless piece of junk.<br /><br />Samsung does not stand behind the products they sell. Samsung has atrocious customer service.  Across the board their products get poor reviews, yet they are unwilling to take any action to correct the problem and maintain good customer relations. They appear to operate under the assumption that  for every dissatisfied customer, there are thousands more willing to buy their shoddy crap. This attitude is unacceptable, especially in these tough economic times.<br /><br /> I will NEVER buy ANY Samsung product, EVER!  Save yourself the aggravation:  DO NOT BUY!|neg
This Whirlpool WMC2005YW 0.5 cubic feet countertop microwave oven is the best microwave we have ever had. We sold our house, where we had a built-in micro, and moved into a condo 4 years ago and bought a small Haier. The only thing good about the Haier was,  it was small, so when it blew out we had to go small again. I totally counted on the reviews for this micro and, thank you everybody, you are so right! I got the white one because my counters are white and it is so cute, just nestled into that small space. The best part is that it really works well. We feared making popcorn, which the Haier never, and I mean never, did well. Always burnt no matter what we tried. This Whirlpool made perfect popcorn at 2 1/2 minutes. We snack on it every night and the bag fits in perfectly with room to spare. It will fit a dinner plate easily and heats evenly. There is a 30 second button, start, stop, and a clock that also doubles as a timer. We have never used the auto buttons. I would buy this again in a minute.|pos
fits well on countertop in small space. Works very well warming and re-heating. Works better that other microwave that was much bigger.|pos
Everything is great!!! Just a warning!!!! Double check the template used for the upper cabinet. Actually check it against the unit. In my case I replaced an older Maytag, so I had two existing holes in my cabinet. Then added two more because of the template only to fine that they do not line up!!!!!! I superimposed the template over the unit and sure enough the holes did not line up!!! So I did not make a mistake!!!! The Template was off. No real big deal but now I have six holes.<br /><br />Double check the holes!!! Unit is great!! Previous unit did not vent out of the house. This one I installed a vent to the outside through the back and it has a really powerful motor. This Microwave gives you three options,Vent back,vent from the top or recirculate. I do not reccomend recirculating!!!! If you can vent this unit or any unit always vent!!!! I had some major issues venting this unit because of structural issues, like wires that I had to reroute etc but I knew that when it was over I would be smiling and I am!!!! For the price this unit works as good as any for much more money and the VENT is the Greatest!!!!!|pos
Bought GE's 2006 model. It became a bread box/clock four days ago (about 9/15/2012). Scheduled one of their authorized repair men. Took him 5 minutes to determine that the only problem was that the microwave generator thingy quit. The display, oven light and turntable are as good as new, but the micro doesn't heat anything. Cost of the part = $400. The good news is that the $75 house call will be offset by getting a coupon redeemable for $100 if I buy another GE Profile over-the-range. My cheap, little, off brand counter top microwave just won't quit working. I'm not certain what to do.<br /><br />One last thing, the halogen surface light quit about six weeks after original purchase. You have to stand on your head, and use a special backhanded screw driver to replace the bulbs. Very convenient feature, but maybe I should have paid an authorized repair tech to replace the bulbs.|neg
My old microwave (dating back to the mid-90s) finally bit the dust.  I was worried that I wouldn't find another compact microwave to replace it, but this one fits the bill.  It is small, but big enough for the needs of our 3-person household.  I find height to be more limiting that width in microwaves, and this one offers about the same height as a regular one.  It's not as powerful as some of the full-sized microwaves, but an extra minute of waiting is worth it for the small footprint.  It's attractive although the buttons are not terribly intuitive.  The rounded back works well for our needs, as it nestles into the corner even better than our previous unit.  After a few months of use, I'm quite pleased with this purchase.|pos
I have been using this microwave for four years now without any issues. A nice deep oven with a really powerful fan. Good results every time I use it!|pos
I purchased this to replace a much larger microwave taking a lot of counter space.  Since we only use a microwave to reheat food and pop popcorn, this microwave is perfect.  I held off using it for several weeks because the inside wall of the microwave had a rectangle piece of cardboard screwed into the side with a metal and some plastic screws.  I removed the screws and cardboard but there were no instructions to tell me to remove it.  Once removed, there was a rectangle hole on the inside wall that was next to the turntable plate.  My old microwave didn't have an open space.  My concern was that if I heat soup, it could run over the bowl and spill inside this open space.  It still doesn't make sense to me because the cardboard couldn't have been meant to be left in since it can't be wiped down when cleaning the inside of the microwave.  Oh well, this mini micro works great and heats everything we need to the correct temp using the approximate times I used on my old microwave.  Yes, I'd purchase this again but I'll also be purchasing a rubber mat to place under it because it slides around when opening or closing the door.|pos
Keypad error SE.  $185 to repair.  I'm getting a new microwave, but can't seem to find a good review on any of them from someone who had it more than 1 year.|neg
Had microwave for about four years and no problems, it was the only one you could<br />see to operate in my center island without getting down on the foor.<br />as for cooking it seems to cook better than my old one with a turntable|pos
After about 18 months of working beautifully, we also got that SE error. Called an authorized dealer and between the cost of a service call, the price of labor and the price of the new keypad, it will cost $200 to fix.  No way!!  I will be purchasing a new microwave and it will most definitely NOT be a Samsung!! Time to issue a recall like they do with cars...they know who has registered this product. We should all be given replacement keyboards free of charge. We need lemon laws for appliances. I urge you to stay away from this one.<br /><br />***UPDATE***<br />I spoke with the authorized service provider and he suggested I contact Samsung directly (1-800-726-7864). I spoke with customer service and then was transferred to Executive Customer Relations. They first offered me a free replacement part but told me I would have to pay for the service call and any labor charges. I told her that was not acceptable as that would still cost me $135. She put me on hold again and came back telling me she could give me as a courtesy a ONE TIME ONLY warranty extension. She made it clear it would not ever be repeated. So, at least now I will have the repair done at no cost to me. Hopefully the new part will last longer than the original.  I suggest you try giving them a call if you are one of the many with this problem.|neg
This product initially worked very well.  Within a few months, we found that the microwave would come on all by itself.  It totally quite working in about 1.5 years.  I have read many complaints just like this one.  It should have been recalled by the manufacturer.  I will never buy this brand again.|neg
Very happy with this purchase. For the money, great product.<br /><br />I was a little concerned, because some had mentioned the clunky door, but I find no problems with it.|pos
RECALL NEEDED - THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED FOR OVER 8 YEARS IN THE SAME MODEL MICROWAVE FROM G.E. IT IS NOT SAFE. ONCE THE WHITE COATING PEELS AWAY AND METAL IS EXPOSED THE UNIT WILL SPARK AND CAN CAUSE A KITCHEN FIRE.    The white coating is bubbling and peeling off of the inner top surface of my microwave. It was manufactured in March 2011 and installed in June 2011. Just over a year ago. The current unit was a replacement for the exact same built-in unit that also was just over a year old and experiencing the same problem. If you purchase one of these units, be sure to purchase an extended warranty.    If you read the comments at the GE community forum you will see that this problem has existed for years. Same product, same model number, same problem over and over. But GE has done nothing to correct it. Read the details at this link:  [...]    Although, it is a useful unit otherwise - lots of great features. But once the coating starts bubbling and peeling you cannot safely use it. Total hazard. Additionally, unless this unit is installed over a range users are probably operating the unit without knowing it is in an unsafe condition because they cannot see the coating peeling away on the top inner surface.    WHY HAS GE NOT RECALLED THIS PRODUCT?|neg
I have a super small kitchen and this microwave fits perfectly inside. It works great and looks pretty cool.  I was hesitant about it fitting a large dinner plate but it does!!! So, it works for all my needs. Maybe the only downside is that you can basically only set it in 30 second intervals but that is normally the type of microwave cooking I do anyway so it's fine for me.|pos
We bought this microwave for our kitchen remodel partly because we also have this same unit in our motorhome.<br />The combination of an outside hood vent, range light, convection oven, and microwave made it a bargain as well.<br />The shipping was perfect. It was packed in 2 boxes, first the manufacture's styro lined box, then that box was bubble wrapped and boxed in a separate larger box.<br />The stainless steel matches our other appliances and looks great!<br />Thanks Sharp, Thanks Amazon|pos
This oven made it about a year before the interior paint started peeling off.  Customer service was not helpful.  This oven cost us at least twice what comparable ovens cost.  We bought it because it fit the space we had available.  Never again.|neg
I spent several thousand dollars on Samsung appliances as part of a kitchen remodel in Oct11.  In May I noticed that when I opened the door of the microwave it appeared to have a short (a bright light flashed then went out).  It still heated but as I thought it might be a fire hazard I contacted Samsung.  They set me up with a service repair company that had a poor rating on Angie's list.  A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).  Instead, I got a call from Samsung a week later saying that the servicecompany had miraculously received the part and they wanted to schedule a service call.  I told her I had been put in for an exchange and she insisted that I again deal with this disreputable service company.  I refused, and since I didn't have the Transaction # she said she would call me back today.  She didn't call this morning when she said she would so I called Samsung.  Just got off the phone with Samsung, who refuses to replace my microwave.  It just seems to be a game of stringing customers along with vague and misleading promises.  The only 2 service companies they have for this area have F ratings on Angie's list.<br />I had a similar situation occur with my 1 month old stove back in December, which broke on Xmas Eve.  After 3 months of fighting with Samsung Best Buy finally felt sorry for me and gave me a new stove.<br />After spending thousands of dollars on Samsung appliances I expected more from Samsung.<br />I would stay away from Samsung or if you do purchase an appliance from them, get an independent warranty.  Customer service is a problem area for them.|neg
Please, please do not buy this microwave. After just a few months it stopped heating intermittently. Then it started tripping our breaker. It only does this occasionally. I have had Samsung repair personnel out twice and they can't fix it. They now say I must have a faulty breaker. Well, we had a Kenmore microwave in the same exact spot for 9 years and it never once tripped the breaker. They have no explanation as to why it doesn't heat. They haven't fixed it, I'm worried the electrical system is faulty, and therefore a fire hazard and Samsung refuses to replace it.  The problems occur sporadically and as a repairman hasn't actually seen it malfunction they don't believe me. Do not buy this OR ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCT!!<br />The total lack of concern for their customer is shocking. My husband and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with some lackey from customer service named Landry H. and all he did was spend the entire time telling us he couldn't help us unless we agreed to a THIRD service call to see if they could catch it not working. He refused to transfer us to anyone else, or offer us any alternatives, no matter how many different things we suggested.  I will never buy a SAMSUNG product again, and to anyone reading this review, for your own sanity.....RUN.|neg
Everyone who visits my apartment always comments on how cool my microwave looks.  This powerful machine is perfect for the typical Manhattan kitchen.  If you are looking for a stylish, functional and space saving microwave - then buy this one!|pos
We purchased our Samsung over the range microwave 14 months ago.  We started getting the 5e but it would clear up overnight.  Then it got so none of the keyboard would not work. I guess we'll have to buy a new microwave but it definitely won't be a Samsung.|neg
i have only been using the product about one month but am very pleased so far.  it is well-designed and solves the problem i had of bending down all the time to access the microwave.  easy to install, looks good.  some reviewers have reported quality problems though i've had none so far.  i will update my review if it fails|pos
I ordered this microwave to replace an over the over microwave we had that stopped working. We wanted something small since we realized we don't use on much anymore except for frozen vegetables and reheating coffee. We needed a small microwave that would fit in a small area. This was the only corner model microwave I could find anywhere online. It is very cute and looks like an old-school television set. The controls are very simple, there is no number pad, you use the + and - minus signs to adjust cook time. This microwave also has a built in timer  which was also very nice. At only 750 watts, it seems to cook at the same rate as out old 1100 watt microwave.<br />Although the price was  higher that a comprable-sized microwave, the size and shape make it worth the extra money.|pos
If this GE Profile Microwave is built like its cousin, the PVM1870, beware of the worst quality control and internal components possible.  In the two years we have owned a PVM1870 Profile, it has had 6 service calls and about every electronic part but the magnetron has been replaced, several components have been replaced TWICE.  I can accept and understand an electronic component failing, but not that many with some replaced twice -- does NOT speak well of either quality internal components, quality internal engineering or quality control.  The only reason that I gave it one star is that a zero star rating is not possible.<br /><br />Addendum:<br />The motor/power supply burned up AGAIN -- plus another service call for the vent door not opening any longer.  Now we are up to 8 service calls on the extended warranty.  This GE product is an ABSOLUTE PIECE OF JUNK and the last GE product we will ever own.  BTW -- the service personnel are excellent and know their jobs -- it is strictly the lack of build quality and quality control for this GE product that has caused so many failures.  It does not deserve ANY stars in the rating.|neg
This was a reeplacement purchase.  Our previous unit had no issues and was locally purchased.  The door was accidentally damaged and could not be easily repaired.  Needed exact replacement for previously purchased trim kit although product reviews concerning.  Within 2 weeks the electronic key board routinely malfunctioned.  Often requires multiple attempts to start.  contacted seller who defered back to GE.  Not the kind of service I expected nor previously experienced with an amazon vendor.  My recommendation is to avoid both (vendor and product)if possible.|neg
I love this little microwave oven.  I just reheat food and cook some frozen dinners, so I wanted something that wasn't a counter space hog, was easy to open and easy to clean, and didn't have a lot of fancy options that I never use.  Previous reviewers have noted that the beep is loud when adding time, and that the seconds have to be added in 5 second increments (so there's a lot of pushing the + button), so I guess there's still room for improvement, but it does exactly what I want it to.  What I particularly like is the solid face without buttons sticking out of it.  Very easy to wipe clean, no worries about liquid getting into the circuitry.|pos
I love this microwave.  It is the perfect size for a small space, it looks nice, and it cooks well for a 750 watt.  The first one I received would not latch and Whirlpool took care of sending me a new one and picking up the old one, even though I did not purchase it directly from them.|pos
I was in a hurry to purchase a microwave after mine had died.  I didn't spend any time researching as I normally do and made an on the spot decision at the store.  That turned in to a huge waste of time.  I bought the microwave, brought it home and installed it only to find that it was a lemon.  The electronics all worked, however, when plugging it in, the fan would kick on while the tray rotated as if the heat sensor was bad.  As a result, the unit did not function.<br /><br />I should have known after reading a few mediocre reviews while I was in the store to stay away.  My desire to get it done outweighed common sense.<br /><br />The Microwave is in the box being returned today and I'll have to do it again and likely drill new holes.  I don't plan on exchanging for the same model.|neg
I bought this less than three years ago.  I seldom use it to heat food.  I only used it for light, fan and timer.  Now, it keeps on beeping and the technician said it will cost me $160 to $200 to repair it.|neg
We got ours three years ago when we redid our appliances and it has been the workhorse of my kitchen.  I cook everything in my microwave and it's so smart it knows how to cook, defrost or reheat everything!  It has been durable and dependable, it's large and versatile.  I have only had to replace a plate (I'm a klutz) and the handle (20-yr-old doesn't know his own strength).  If you want the best microwave ever, get it!|pos
Have owned this microwave for about 2.5 years. Has been a great performer albeit a bit longer cooking times because of it's low wattage. However, about 6 months ago the interior paint began to chip. There is now about one third of the inside paint missing. Have read numerous complaints regarding this problem on other sites so ours is not an isolated incidence. Most consumer info that is available states that the chipping paint is not unsafe. I don't know about you but I don't prefer my food with paint chips in it. I'm sure soon it will start sparking from all of the exposed metal. Haven't replaced it yet as we can't find a replacement to fit our space requirements.|neg
We bought this microwave in the summer of 2011. It did not heat even when first installed. Whirlpool sent a repairman who fixed it, only after three months of work and making several orders for different parts. Six months later, it stopped heating again. We have asked for a replacement but Whirlpool will only send the repairman again. They will not replace the product even though we have been unable to use it less than half the time we have owned it. This product is a lemon and not supported by the manufacturer. I have read many other reviews that indicate the same thing. We will never buy Whirlpool or any other brand made by this company again! We desire to buy American, but not at the cost of buying inferior products from a company with lousy customer service!|neg
There is no brand name of the front of this appliance, which is nice because you can then pair it with your other appliances that may be a different brand. Which in my case was Whirlpool...just a note: Whirpool and Amana are one in the same.<br />I had it installed by a professional. I do not know if it was difficult to install. This is not a direct wire appliance, you will need an outlet in the cupboard above in order to plug it in.<br />So far no complaints. I have not had much time to use it...1 week since installation.|pos
My wife wanted this item after conducting a great deal of internet research on it. I had been used to using a 10 year old microwave and did not think I would be that impressed with this new model. I was wrong. This is one of the best appliances that I've ever purchased.|pos
We bought this Frigidiare microwave in the hopes of getting a solid over the range microwave to use.  Before it was two years old it began to smoke and sputter as it began to burn up.  We killed the power and shut it down.  We contacted Frigidaire and were told it was out of warranty.  We told them we were reporting a safety hazard that they should be aware of.  We were told that it was impossible for the microwave to do what ours had done.  No support, rejection of safety hazard report, no offer of repair or replacement.<br /><br />We think you will regret buying this product.  We do.  Complete waste of money.|neg
Absolutely love it! Takes up very little counter space - large inside, great height, would highly recommend. Purchesed for a cleaner counter look and that is exactly what i have. Many compliments from guests; everyone wants to know where they can order one.|pos
I received a Danby Microwave for Christmas 2011.  Less than 4 months later it stop working  I called the Danby 800# and was told what to do.  I did this and have not heard anything back.  I have attempted numerous times with no success on getting my refund.  Loss to my family of $85.00<br /><br />I will never buy another Danby product or recommend one.|neg

After installing a new double oven to replace a single with a microwave combo I was left in need of a countertop microwave. It had to be small so as not to take up counterspace and I needed blue display lights to match all of my other appliances' light displays (things like that annoy me). Black or silver...all my appliances are stainless and my granite is black. This is perfect. Fits in the corner and easy to use. Looks like an odd little tv...which I like since I like quirky looking things that do their job. I boght several other microwaves these past few weeks- pure stainless...blck...larger...even the nostalgia retro one...all went back...this one is perfect. I don't do major cooking in a microwave and if takes a few seconds longer, well, it really does not matter as we are all in too big of a rush anyway:)|pos
kids love to use it wife does too. Works under bar. it is a perfect space saver. hard to break! Love it.|pos
I have had this microwave less than 2 years and I too am getting the SE error code.  It is $99 just for someone to look at it!  You can't press any of the buttons.  This obviously is a manufacturer issue if there are so many complaints about it.  Now I have to spend another $300 on a new microwave not Samsung.|neg
I don't find this microwave any noisier than others I've owned. I also find it very easy to use even without reading the instructions. So far it heats food evenly and is pretty powerful. Great basic, affordable microwave.|pos
Replaced an existing OTR microwave that had a burnt out magnetron. It's been several months since install, and I am still very happy.<br /><br />1) Carousel works.<br />2) Has a convenient 30 second or single button push for 1-9 minute intervals Can warm up small dishes or teas with the 30 second quickstart.<br />3) Nukes food up really quickly.<br />4) Very easy to install. Even with a old house, I used the printed template to drill guideholes and place in the retention frame. Took me two hours, and I was able to pop it in place all by myself.<br />5) Vent does a good job at sucking.<br /><br />Got it in fast, and in great condition. If you need a cheap replacement, this is it.|pos
This is a great small microwave. It fits in a small area. Replaces an existing. This works much better. Do recommend|pos
Two days in and I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Small foot print, excellent build quality and yet holds a full size plate. It's also the quietest microwave I have ever owned. You can barely hear it. The LCD is super bright and the controls are so easy to use. I love how the entire front sure is flat - makes for really easy clean up. I would so buy this again and again.|pos
I brought a samsung SMH9187ST back Nov. 2010, which is the same exact microwave as the SMH 1816S with the exaact same features listed. On June 14, 2011, I had a technician come to my home to repair this unit. This unit was under warranty at the time. On May 6,2012, samsung microwave display SE on the screen. Call samsung office and they referred me to a service tech. also, stating the unit was not under warranty regardless of the last repair date. I call the service tech. office somewhere in Norcross,GA.to find out what it would cost for a visit to my home. The office employee(not the tech.) stated the tech. visit for my area would be $140.00 to look at and replace the unit part which would cost $75.00. Total cost $215.00 The employee that was not a tech. quoted me the cause of my problem and the part that cause the problem without some even looking at the unit. Sounds like the repair company already have a lot of information without every touching or looking at this samsung microwave unit. This appears to be an on going problem with this unit even though the on thing that has change is the model number Samsung SMH1816S.<br />If, you have not had a problem in the first year consider yourself lucky. When you have had two problems in 18 months with this unit it is time for a recall on your product. Stay away from this microwave unless you don't mind an inconvenience and spending more money.|neg
Worked great for the first 2 years than completely broken.  AFter charging me $99 to look at my microwave, the GE repairman indicated that the repair would cost over $400.  Wow - what a ripoff.  I expected a profile to last a little longer than that.  If you want to replace this in 2 years - go ahead and buy.  Otherwise, look for a brand other than GE.|neg
This microwave was installed by our builder in our new home a year and a half ago.  I'm not sure why, as I have since found out that the service technician for this area has been out numerous times to replace these microwaves.  Ours died after 17 months of regular use.  It will run but will not heat anything.  I called Whirlpool to troubleshoot this, and all they did was put me through an automated call that set up a service appointment.  At no point did they tell me what this service call would cost.  So I had to call back and get a customer service rep who told me it would be $129 for someone to come out to my home.  That of course does not include any parts or replacement.  I can buy a brand new microwave that works from a better company for twice that.  Why would I fix a microwave that broke in a little over a year of use.  In all my years of microwave use, I have never had a microwave break.  It's pretty ridiculous to me to have it break in a little over a year, especially when my neighbor had hers break two months prior.  I would never buy a Whirlpool appliance again.|neg
We bought this mainly because it had to be the same size as our old one, to fit into a space in our cabinets, and this was the closest. A bonus was the turntable, which my husband really likes.  It is larger inside than the old one, and more powerful, in the same space!  We have used it 4 months now with no issues at all.  The door does close and open rather hard, so we ease it closed, otherwise we love it! The controls are very easy to use.  We had a bit of trouble installing it, we could not get the bottom slots in the microwave  to slip onto the bracket, so we just bent the bottom of the bracket so the microwave sits on on it, and it is screwed to the cabinet from the top.  A good choice if it becomes available again.|pos
I purchased the Danby as a gift for my nephew who has a small apartment. I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable. Highly recommend.|pos
I have to agree with the other 1 star review. I would also give it zero stars if possible. This is my second GE Microwave that has died after one year. Last time it was the turntable motor, this time it was the control panel.  Of course the replacement is over $125. They produce garbage. No more GE for me.|neg
Perfect replacement for my old one.  It is deeper than my old one but not to an extreme.  I can nuke larger items now.|pos
This microwave has had one problem after another since it was installed close to a year ago. It's prone to all sorts of computer malfunctions. Let's see if I can even remember them all. We've had it start up again after pulling food out and closing the door (without hitting start again). It's often (50+ times) sounded as if it was working, but when I realized it had been an awfully long time without it chiming, I found that it had frozen just a few seconds into the heating. The most disturbing problem was that it has on perhaps five occasions turned on on its own--with no one in the room. There have been many occasions where it has just not worked at all. When this happened, unplugging it and plugging it back in used to reset it so that it would work. Unfortunately, it now won't work at all, with just the code, SE flashing on its display.<br /><br />We're buying a new microwave this weekend, and I can guarantee it won't be a Samsung.|neg
In January 2011 I purchased a PEM31SMSS GE spacesaver microwave because it was the only microwave with >400 watts of power I could find that would fit in the space I have.  It looked nice - better than a plain black box.  Approximately 4 months later the keypad stopped working and the microwave was replaced under warranty.  In August of 2011 the replacement microwave wouldn't turn off, and was replaced under warranty.  In March of 2012 after heating a cup of coffee, the third microwave just went dark and wouldn't work any more.  The stainless model was no longer available and was replaced with the black, which arrived yesterday.  Today I unpacked it and plugged it in.  The interior light won't turn off and there is no keyboard response when I press the START button because something in the latch isn't making contact.  I think I've had one of everything that could go wrong.  I would definately not recommend purchasing a GE spacemaker microwave of any style.|neg
Picked this up at our local Lowes for a good price. This model has the real stainless handle, and not the painted-grey handle I saw on a lower end model. We installed it with minimal problems for our kitchen out of the 1960's that usually has non standard things (finding a fridge that fit was very painful). We needed one with a low clearance distance to the cook-top - 14 inches or less, and Samsung meets the bill at 13 inches. After using a counter-top microwave for the past few years, this seems huge. I'm still learning all the features, but am certainly pleased by the power of the fan. I'm exploring the use of the sensor cooking and can't wait to use the rack to be able to actually cook the amount of squash I want at once - the old microwave was just too small. I'll update this review if I run into any problems as we run it through it's paces, but so far it was relatively easy to install and is easy to use.|pos
I bought this microwave based on the Consumer Reports product ratings and up until a couple of days ago I would have highly recommended it. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. I awoke to sounds of it beeping every few minutes and an error code of SE. After a lot of research I have seen that this same code has appeared for a fair amount of others. Both the short and the long of it is that it can no longer be used with out spending good money after bad. I know that they don't make things now days to last a lifetime, but I would have hoped for it to last longer than less than 2 years. We are light users and I kept it very clean. I wish that I would have bought an extended warranty. I can only hope that I go the same way this did...quick and without warning and that someone would also say she was good while she lasted.|neg
Bought a Sharp Microwave Drawer one and a half years ago. Barely used it - warming leftovers once a week and softening butter a few times. Started to make funny noises and gave off an electrical smell. Because I bought it from an American Supplier - Sharp Canada is saying I have no warranty and suggest that I send the microwave to a family member in the US to have it repaired. This is ludicrous. Sharp US says I have to deal with Sharp Canada. To get it repaired here it will cost $286. Either way it will cost a small fortune to repair.|neg
[[ASIN:B000UW1WW8 GE Profile : JES2251SJ 2.2 cu. ft. Countertop Microwave with Child Lockout and Extra Large<br />Capacity<br />I purchased this product less than two years ago & today it finally just stopped.This was considered a very good micro, however it should have lasted much longer. I no longer have any faith in GE products and would never recomend this product to anyone!|neg
After owning this microwave for less than 3 years, we have had the door handle break off on the bottom TWICE!  The first time we had it fixed - which cost nearly as much as the microwave.  This was just over 1 year after purchasing (of course, because it was no longer under warranty).  Now, just over three years in, it has broken off again - exact same problem.  Oh, AND the glass on the front of the door somehow came undone on the top and fell down about two inches.  Absolutely the worst appliance we have ever owned.  I have also had problems with my LG dryer after less than 4 years of owning it.  LG should track down everyone who purchased this microwave and give them a refund.  I will never, ever buy another LG product again, no matter what type.|neg
This is the first 1,200 watt microwave I've ever owned. It took just a while to figure out I didn't need things to heat as long, but once I figured it out, it is the best microwave I've ever owned. The only drawback I have is I wish the completed beeper was louder. Other than that, I am thoroughly satisfied with this microwave.|pos
Our JES2251SJ02 lasted 4 months past the 12 month warranty. The inverter blew and the cost for a replacement inverter was $225, a new JES2251SJ02 is $258 so were trashing it. GE is sending us a $100 credit check good only for another GE appliance. The repair man recommended buying the cheapest microwave available and getting the extended warranty on any appliance. Everything out there is trash, said he. I'm afraid he is right.|neg
I've had two service calls with this microwave within the one year warranty.  If it goes again, they tell me I am on my own. Shame on Whirlpool. I suspect that it may be more efficient to purchase a new microwave instead of having a service call for a circuit board that continues to be an issue. I'd steer away from this one....|neg
We moved into a house that already had the MCO160UW microwave oven installed. After a few months the microwave would stop working and then randomly run on by its self for 3 minutes and 30 seconds. After deciding the microwave needed to be replaced for safety reasons we looked for another. We purchased one with the same length and width but after installing it realized the adjacent cabinet door wouldnt open since it  is at an angle due to the microwave sticking out too far from the wall. The standard size is 16'deep and up. Anything over 15' deep will stick out too far for the cabinet to open and the ONLY microwave available anywhere with 14.9' depth was this one. We desperately needed a new microwave so decided to give this same model, MCO160UW, a second try it failed again after 1 week of use. It will not run longer than 1 minute and 30 seconds at a time until it shuts off. In order to use it again you must wait a few minutes for it to turn back on. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.|neg
I've had this microwave for a year now, and it has performed flawlessly. It also looks great, and is very easy to clean, inside and out. The best thing is the one-touch start for things like tea and re-heating. I don't feel like I have to program a computer just to make something to eat.|pos
Good quality product.  Installed well and works great.  Some reviewers commented on the way the door closes, but I have found it to be just fine.  Hopefully it will last a long time.  I would recommend.  3/2013 Update:  The microwave has worked flawlessly for the past year.  Very pleased with it.  With lots of use and much by teenagers, it has shown to be sturdy and solidly built thus far.  It also cooks very efficiently.  Still happy and would still recommend.|pos
This microwave stopped working 364 days after we bought the house. Unfortunately it was the Firday before a holiday weeked and I was not able to contact Whrilpool until the following week. Whrilpool refused to honor the warranty when I called becasue it was two day expired.   A service repair man then came to the house to diagnose the problem. He told me the the microwave needed an new magnetron and control board. However, he said me that I should just get a different microwave. If I replaced the parts in this microwave he would probably be back in another year becuase Whrilpool had so many problems with this model. After that recommendation I looked at reviews on the Whrilpool web sight and Amazon, defective magnetrons seem to be a problem with this unit.   I would not recommend purchasing this unit since it seems that there is a problem with functionality and their warranty department is unwilling to budge on anything.|neg
This is a great microwave. It works great and it looks beautiful. I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.|pos
I bought this Microwave oven on June 1st 2010.  The handle is broken apart and the handle is loose  also the bottom of the doors have a crack.|neg
I am completely disappointed in this microwave.  It stopped working after about 16 months, hence it was beyond warranty.  Every microwave I have ever owned has lasted at least 5 years!  Now Whirlpool wants to charge me $100.00 service fee?  This despite all of the documented magnetron issues in the reviews, yet they claim to not have any documented problems with this model.  DO NOT purchase a microwave from Whirlpool.  It's beautiful to look at, but now it's just a giant (pricey) paperweight hanging above my range.  I'll never buy anything from them again! It doesn't DESERVE a star, and neither does Whirlpool's customer service!|neg
I had been using this microwave for only about two years when it suddenly began turning itself on! REALLY scary!! A bad fire hazard, and I have found others who report the same phenomenon with the same model. Wondering why it has not been recalled and who to lodge a complaint with!!|neg
We owned this unit over 3 years.  The electronics went bad after a year.  It took 6 tries to get it working.  As reported elsewhere in these reviews, the machine would turn on all by itself.  Scary and dangerous.  Whirlpool would not replace the unit.  I wonder why these units weren't recalled.    The plastic parts (not a stainless steel unit) distorted and cracked in several places.  Those parts were replaced (under a separate warranty contract) 3 times!  The unit again has cracks and no warranty.  Last week, the bottom part of the door handle pulled out of the unit; it's held in by a small rubber flange that is sandwiched between the outer glass and an inner flat plastic piece.  Websites tell me that the glass must be disassembled to get a new handle inserted!  Gad!  It's outta here.  And the real shame is that the cooking functions are excellent.  But the next one will not be a Whirlpool, nor any other of Whirlpool brands. (Whirlpool makes/owns Whirlpool, KitchenAid, Admiral, Amana, Jenn-Air, Magic Chef, and Maytag.)|neg
Update: Jan 21, 2012  Just when I thought my experience with Frigidaire could not get any worse, it in fact did.  Having the WARRANTY is worse than not having one.  The Microwave is not working from just around Christmas.  Early January, it should have been fixed.  The Service company called and told me that the parts are not available, so the next possible touch point is Feb 18th.  So, looking at guaranteed no microwave for about 2 months, and even after that there is uncertainty when it would be fixed.  Had I NOT had the Warranty, I would have just taken a loss and gone ahead an purchased another Microwave of a brand called NOT FRIGIDAIRE.  ===========  - This Microwave lasted less than 6 months  - Of course you think all should be fine because it is under warranty.  - Yes, it is under warranty, BUT:    a) you are given the direct contact of a Service Provider, and you are no longer working with Frigidaire directly.    b) So, the buck is passed from Frigidaire over to a third party Appliance Service company    c) The appliance service company guy came, took a look at the Microwave and said they will need to order parts either from their local supplier, or directly from distributor. This could take up to 10 days  So, now you are left hanging without a  Microwave for 10 days or more. With the time off needed to be away from Office to handle the multiple appliance service company appointments, the Warranty is just not worth it.  Also, called Frigidaire customer service.  The Customer Service person was TERRIBLE, and basically told me to deal with it and stop complaining.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A FRIGIDAIRE PRODUCT.|neg
Mounting an over the range microwave is a pain. The price is not worth replacing the unit every 10-11 months. Buy something else.|neg
This item works great, was pretty easy to install and matches our kitchen. Exactly what it says in the description, arrived on time. We have no complaints whatsoever with this item. I would definitely recommend it!|pos
I had this installed when I did my first kitchen remodel about 6 years ago. Then all of a sudden in April of 2009, the unit stopped working. Everything else was fine except that it would not heat the food. It would even make all the noise and so on. So, I had to replace it, and decided to just buy a new one and reinstall it. To my horror, less than 2.5 years later, I have the exact same failure. On top of this, if you need any repair service, they charge you a minimum of $100 to just come and diagnose and on top of that charge you for parts and labor! I am so unhappy and furious for this to have happened twice in a row. I will never again buy anything from GE!!! And charging almost 40% of the price of a new unit just for someone showing up at your door is quite silly.|neg
Microwave MCO165UW  over heats and turns off.  First week had repairman out, ordered parts, after 3 weeks Magic Chef still had not sent parts, sent them 2 day.  Repairman came back out and replaced parts.  Still overheated.  Magic Chef said heat water if it does not turn off it works like it is suppose to.  Cannot steam vegetables, cook baked potatoes and so forth.  Who buys a microwave just to heat water?  Do yourself a favor and NEVER BUY Magic Chef.|neg
My story is so similar to the other reviews.  Bought mine in 3/2008 - loved it worked fabulous for about a year.  Just to the end of the warranty.  Whirlpool's response to my request for warranty service at 13 months on a top of the line appliance was Tough Luck - you should have bought our warranty.  I got it fixed $200.  Then I bought the warranty - $125.  Two months later, it was down again.  Over 3 months, and 4 appointments, they replaced nearly every interior part.  Finally it was fixed again.  Two weeks later.....it is down again.  Very disappointing.|neg
it works|pos
Wow, Wow, Wow! I was somewhat concerned about purchasing a microwave over the internet, but how great it was. I was even more than satisfied with the product it looks wonderful and works great as well. The price was less than the one we saw in the store and the delivery time was faster than what the computer stated. I had it install the same day and I am very happy about this product and the overall purchase. I know you will too.|pos
When I opened the box, I saw the corner next to the push button was lose.  The thin and cheap stainless steel is only on the front, everything else is either painted metal and plastic.   I can't believe that the seller Abes of Maine Cameras and Electronics did not check the product before ship to the customer|neg
Dont buy frigidaire. I bought a set of appliances (this being one of them) and the only one I havent had issues with is the stove so far. Haven't even had the stuff a full year.|neg
The first time I used it, I was disappointed with it, but I don't know if it just got better, or if I pushed the wrong button the first time because it's been great since. Nice and roomy interior, easy to install (I did it completely by myself, though I recommend you have a friend). I did forget to change the fan so that it vented up at first, so I had to take it down to do that, but once you get the frame mounted on the wall, that part is easy. The hardest part was mounting it to the cabinet above... I'm not sure how they could have made it any easier though, the problem is mostly a matter of physics.    I would recommend this to anyone needing a decent power microwave to go over their range.|pos
We bought this to replace our GE that died after several services. Turned out to be very cheesy and after the warranty ran out the door handle cracked and then finally broke off. We will be replacing this with a GE which we should've done from the get go. This was a low price microwave but as the old saying goes...you get what you pay for . Some items can't be skimped on.|neg
I would NEVER recommend this microwave to anyone. Within only a few months of owning, the handle broke off, and the front plastic cracked. Of course my husband lost the receipt, so we could not return it, so we've dealt with it with no handle for a year. Now the whole front plastic has broken off and the glass fell out so we can't use it any more. Why would LG continue to make such a poorly constructed product? The plastic is brittle and the construction is bad. I would say this microwave does not even heat food as well as some of my past cheap counter top models. If I could give this product 0 stars, I would. Please do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this product. We will never buy LG again.|neg
I have had this microwave three years.  The only problem I ever have with it is that the door sticks sometimes.  I just have to tug on it every once in a while.  The oven works consistently and does everything it should.  The defrost stops intermittently to tell you to turn things over or separate them or whatever.  That is sometimes helpful and sometimes not -- If I have just one chicken breast in there to defrost I have to hit the button to resume defrost about three or four times.  I do respond by turning the chicken over one of those times.  I defintely recommend the microwave.|pos
I bought my microwave directly from Whirlpool in March 2011. In July 2011 it died. The first repair man came out a week later. He order parts waited another week , second repair man came out to put in the new part. He said it was fried & could not be fix. Well whirlpool is supposed to be replacing the microwave. It's 4 week later close to 5 weeks & still no microwave. The service department is awful.|neg
The GE Profile countertop microwave 2.2 cu.ft. is not only a sleek looking appliance on our counter but is easy to use and allows for large capacity food items.  Very satisfied with our purchase.|pos
This microwave was very hard to install, and I am pretty handy. Within a month the numbers stopped lighting up and some of the touch buttons (such as defrost button) stopped working. Within another month the push button door latch stopped functioning and we had to take it off, now we have to use a screwdriver to pop the door open. The stainless steel started to turn brownish and doesn't come off. Recently the lights started turning on by themselves and today was the last straw when the fan came on by itself and wouldn't turn off. That is why I am on here looking for a new one. Save yourself a major headache and don't buy it!!|neg
I was laughing when I read the reviews, the same exact thing happen to us, we just bought a new condo and the microwave came with it. I started thinking that may be the house was haunted or something. The control panel stopped working and the microwave start by itself and stop by itself. Stay away from this microwave you'll waste your money.|neg
My 1st unit fried and was unuasable. It was replaced after a few customer service calls and a service tech visit. The replacement unit makes a big noise and the vent fan is so loud that the entire sub division could hear our microwave. I have gone through several calls to their customer service and two service visits later the issue is still not fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. It wasn't my choice..I got it from the new home I purchased and I am sure it's not going to last even 3 months.|neg
Danby model DMW111KBLDB will heat for less than a minute then shows an error code and stops.  Bottom of right side gets very hot.  Brand new, returning it for sure.  Perhaps another brand will do better.     Danby promotes themselves as one of the largest household appliance marketing companies in North America.  Aren't they the manufacturer of this product?|neg
What I like about the Whirlpool/Kitchen Aid microwaves is they offer models with Accuwave cooking.  When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.|neg
Update:<br />After 16 months we have the same problem as others. It runs for 3 or 4 seconds and just shuts off.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />I have only owned the microwave for a short time so I can not rate the reliability, not that my individual experience would necessarily be typical.  However, I can rate the features and design of the unit. I like the size, the power and the large turntable.  The controls, however, were poorly designed.  For example, to cook at anything other than full power, you need to press the power level repeatedly. The first press of the button gives you 100% power and each subsequent press reduces the power level by 10%. So, to cook something at 30% power it takes eight presses of the button.|neg
This machine's finish quality was off out of the box.  The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.  Unfortunately, this machine is far, far, far from being a good buy much less a Best Buy!!!  Based on my experience and those of the others who wrote in here I won't be touching a GE microwave for years, if then.|neg
I have been shipped TWO of these microwaves and they were both DOA. Different issues. Sharp might consider testing them before they leave the factory. I won't purchase another sharp microwave. The customer service was slow and did nothing to help me. I could haul it to a local service center and they said that the tech might be able to fix it while I waited but I've been to enough service centers to know that this is not likely. I'm not happy at all.|neg
My daughter had a GE microwave/oven combo. The microwave had the infamous GE flaking paint interior problem. The cost of replacing the integrated units to correct the microwave was very steep. So I bought a can of this paint to see if it would work.<br /><br />To my amazement, it did! Now it wasn't easy, I had to degrease the inside of the oven (TSP), then sand it by hand and some machine for about an hour to get all the base paint solid. I used PaintStriper sanding blocks, 60 and 100 grit, the followed up with some 150 grit paper. Then I had to mask the oven opening with masking tape, paper, and a cheap plastic tarp to beware of overspray.<br /><br />Pro - Followed the directions on the can, and sprayed away! It worked and is still holding up 3 weeks later. So about $35 in material has, so far, stopped a very expensive (hundreds of dollars) oven replacement.<br /><br />Cons - The paint is acetone based so ventilation is a MUST .  Pick a day when doors and windows can be open and I would get the kids out of the house. The paint does dry very fast in about an hour.|pos
Great product.  Fits perfectly in the space we have for it and works like a charm.  Sleek and effective!|pos
this microwave is incredible!  very quiet and the convenience of a drawer is great!  easy to use and to clean!|pos
My Sharp drawer microwave is so much more than I even hoped for.  It is convenient.  The button to open and button to close OR easy pull to open or easy nudge to close and it finishes opening or closing by itself!  Love that!  I had to REPROGRAM myself to go easy to get it opening or closing, then let it finish all by itself.  I was impatient because it takes 2 seconds rather than 1/2 second that I used on my previous microwave to jerk it open or slam it shut.  It's good for me to slow down for 2 seconds!  There are more single cook options than I have used yet. I really like the push START once to get one minute cook time, 2 pushes for 2 minutes, etc.  Can do the same to add a minute while cooking.  SENSOR REHEAT and SENSOR COOK buttons are useful, but as in prior microwaves, I have to still keep a check on how it's cooking.  It seems to cook evenly, but I probably will get a windup turntable if I can still find one.    It holds a 9x13 pan with room to spare.  The 1000W power cooks fast.  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!|pos
I purchased this produce when it first came it and loved the look of the unit.  Within a year the interior paint has peeled off on the inside of the door and the inside of teflon coating of the unit.  The stainless still overs have been glued back on 3 times now and just recently the door handle broke.  I never leave review because honestly I am too lazy but I just had to warn buyers of this product.  I have contacted Whirlpool twice and they told me that the paint was cosmetic and is only covered under the 30 day warranty.  Really??? paint is supposed to chip within 30 days?  Then the other parts are also cosmetic but they can get an technician to come out at my cost of course.  Lastly, despite all the bad reviews, the have determined this product has no quality issues. I will NEVER buy a whirlpool product again.|neg
I have made the mistake of buying two GE space saver microwaves for my two homes. Both have badly peeling paint not only inside the door but on the back wall of the microwave as well. Got same answer form GE.buy the paint and paint it myself.  Did buy the paint but by then the rust was too extensive to nake it work. I am also looking for a nice microwave about the same size and features!|neg
As a vertically-challenged individual, I was looking forward to getting a countertop microwave when we remodelled our kitchen.  However, I was not looking forward to giving up the multiple functions offered by my larger, over-the-stove microwave.  Additionally, I did not want to give up my useable counter space which I would have to do with the standard 18 inch or more deep countertop microwaves.  I also wanted enough space left on the counter so that, if necessary, when removing something from the microwave, I could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave.  I had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage, but was certain I would not find a suitable microwave to fit.  Since we were not replacing cabinets, I had to work with the available spaces.<br /><br />To my surprise, the GE Profile Spacemaker II was the exact size of the nook!  Although there were many negative reviews of the product, I decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at Best Buy.  Through an abundance of caution, I also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if I experience any of the problems others have encountered, I will be able to have the Spacemaker II repaired or replaced.  As the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost, I felt it was worth the expenditure.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the GE Profile Spacemaker II microwave.  My spouse and I do not cook meals in our microwave, but do reheat beverages; cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers; and, occasionally, defrost meat.  The Spacemaker performs these functions admirably!  Although it takes about 30% more time to heat/cook things than my 1100 watt microwave, this has not been a problem.  Further, I like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do.  The control panel buttons are very responsive.  I have cracked other microwave's button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.<br /><br />In the past, I have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave.  I found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave, and the temperature remains consistent.  The Spacemaker's interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread.<br /><br />Because I keep this microwave on my counter, I keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron.<br /><br />Further, I would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons.  The GE Profile Spacemaker II has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose.  Thus, it might not be the best choice for individuals.<br /><br />For me, the GE Profile Spacemaker II is the ideal microwave and I am giving it a five-star rating.  If things change, I will update my review accordingly.s button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.

fridgidaire over the range (fmv 156 dca) looks nice but nothing but trouble.  First the handle broke. I fixed it. Then the diode/rectifire failed--i replaced that and the magnitron, worked for a year than died in the middle of cooking a baked potatoe. Replaced diode--still not working. I am giving up and never buying fridigaire again.  BTW i replaced it with a maytag--what do you know, as soon as i tried to cook some popcorn it shut off. It only will stay on for 10 seconds or so before shutting off. I am taking it back and am wondering how much bad luck can one have--or is this all a conspiracy to keep microwave service people busy.|neg
Looks good, and had all the features we wanted.  Too bad it melted it's wiring last night.  Costs more to repair than to simply replace with newer less expensive model.|neg
We purchased a new house which led us to purchase a new microwave and refrigerator.  We chose GE for both.  After six months the ice maker stopped working.  After 6 years, a refrigerator which still looks brand new, was freezing all of the food in the refrigerator section.  Next came the refrigerator section not cooling at all.  We had to go purchase yet another refrigerator as we couldn't deal with our food going back all the time based on the reliability of this refrigerator.  Moved this GE refrigerator down the basement to use for excess drinks, etc. during the holidays.  Repair man just left after telling me it was too expensive to fix and he would not guarantee that something else didn't go wrong.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, my GE microwave broke last week also.  After reading the reviews/complaints on GE appliances, I will never ever put a GE appliance in my house.  Spread the word.....|neg
I bought this appliance over a year ago and since then have been having a lot of problems with the door. The plastic handle cracked a few months after use, and this was repaired by their service. A few months later, the same problem occurred again, but this time created a tiny crack on the door itself. Again it was serviced for the handle alone. Just after the 1-year warrantee expired, the handle cracked the 3rd time, this time creating a much bigger fissure on the door so that it now cannot be opened. While the machine still functions, the design of the door is so poor that I would not at all buy another microwave from LG again. In all the houses I have owned, this is the first time I have any problems with any microwave.I would not at all recommend it.|neg
Door broke near the handle in less than one year.  Had the door replaced under warranty.  Now the new door is breaking in the exact same fashion in less than a year (but now it's out of warranty!).  New door costs over $100.  Serious design or manufacturing flaw.  I can't recommend this microwave.  Very disappointed.|neg
After our old Microwave died we started searching the market online and in stores.  I purchased Consumer Reports for microwaves and then searched for them on Amazon to read the customer reviews.  The top ten rated had horrible customer reviews.  So then decided to search from the bottom of the list up, and this is when I found our next microwave.  Loud was the only beef with this microwave.  Now in our house loud with all our kids is nothing compared to a microwave.  Basically if your trying to sleep near by this microwave then maybe it would seem loud.  But the 1200 watts cooks everything super fast, even heat with the turning tray is awesome!  This is used several times a day and after a month no complaints!|pos
I had this microwave GH7208XRS slightly over one year ago. Today the digital display went out. It is going to cost alot of repair it. I definitely would not recommend anyone buy this unit unless you get the extended warranty.|neg
My husband & I were looking for a microwave for my daughter & her husband for a Christmas gift.  This is the same brand that we have & are very happy w/ it.  This is exactly what we were looking for & so happy to find it @ such a reasonable price.  Their home is nearing completion & they are so excited to install this microwave & start using it.  Our daughter said that she just loves the modern look & knows that it'll look wonderful w/ all their other stainless steal appliances.|pos
We replaced our 15 year old GE Profile Spacemaker with a new updated GEProfile Spacemaker Microwave Oven.  It is basically the same one with big subtle improvements.  I am probably the only one who used the old microwave with all of  its bells and whistles.  I am amazed at how updated these items are today.   Forinstance to cook fresh vegetables just load them in and push the veggie button.  Somehow it senses when they are cooked to perfection and not rubber.  I cooked a  perfect scrambeled egg in one minute, stirring once.      We oredered the undermount hardware just because.  Guess what?  Since we replaced  the identical microwave the old mount fit perfectly. Oh well.    I really would have loved it in stainless steel but didn't see it offered.    I do hope this gives us another 15 years but at that price I am not too worried  about the track record. The first GE over the stove microwave I bought 30 years  ago was $600!|pos
Looks great, functions awesome while it is working. But with the digital display, it breaks very soon, and when it breaks, it feels like you can't get it fixed. Whirlpool would not respond well. They just direct us to local repair shops, and the response from them is horrible. Any replacement parts are always on back order and it is just a night mare to try to work with them sanely. I have been fighting with them for more 6 months now, and I just am so frustrated that I spend so much money on a product that would only work for few months, and I kept this useless microwave sitting nicely in the middle of my kitchen, just idle.     Horrific design and horrible customer service from Whirlpool.|neg
We've owner this product for several years now.  It looks nice and works great.  Amazon handles the shipping of this heavy product with ease so you don't need  to be concerned about it getting to you in top condition.|pos
We also experienced problems with the paint peeling in this microwave.  It is no longer under warrenty and I was told by GE that this was an isolated incident.  Obviously, that is not the case.  I would not recommend this product especially since GE is unwilling to stand behind their product.|neg
We have had this microwave for about a month and absolutely love it!  Well worth the price.  It is super convenient, you can see and stir the food without removing it from the oven.  Cooks evenly and quickly.  Easy to use and clean. Very attractive, a conversation piece as well.|pos
After owning a previous Sharp microwave/convection oven I bought this one.  Installed 5 years ago and still just as pleased as the day it was installed.  Excellent even microwave and oven performance.  Highly recommend this product.|pos
I've had this mic for just over a year, and as with others, it just started turning on by itself this week. Fire hazard! Thank God I was home the first time it did it. It's 2.30am and it just woke me up by coming on again. Spooky to say the least, dangerous to say the most. I can't keep it plugged in anymore, and I assume, based on others' experience that I'm reading online, that it is no longer safe and I will have to get rid of it. What a rip off.|neg
I purchased a GE Profile Spacemaker 2.0 oven model #JVM2070 BHO2 in 2007. About a year later the handle came off in my hand. I did my own repair but in so doing found the quality of construction to be quite poor. Self threaded screws in inferior quality plastic was the problem. Now, the keypad will not accept any inputs. GE only sells a control assembly at nearly $400 (the oven originally cost about $500). GE says their ovens are not consumer repairable and refer customers to a repair facility. My options are to pay a GE technician $75.00 to tell me the control assembly must be replaced at a cost of $400 or buy another brand of oven with a longer service life. Which option do you think I will choose?|neg
Too many problems for a high end microwave. After 1 year of use, the handle broke. The convection piece of it will not work. Stay away from this product.|neg
I bought this microwave a few years back. Broke a year ago, waited a year to get it fix. This morning technician replaced inverter, worked......than he noticed it was on and off heating. Didn't warm up a cup of water. Told me the magnetron would need to be replaced. All about $500. STAY AWAY! Can't believe I spent $1,000 on this and 3 years later it's near the curb.......damn.....what an idiot I am....thanks Whirlpool...|neg
Excellent price and product (2 day shipping with Amazon Prime - another really good investment!). This has turned out to be a very good buy as a replacement for a Sears Kenmore over the range microwave - which was useless from day one. It fits well, very secure mounts and easy to use template. Oven itself is easy to use, quiet, powerful, excellent venting (in our case out the top - to the roof). Everything has been easy to clean so far (including the buttons and window). I put it in myself - but two person job would have been a better choice. Really like the sensor cooking (so I don't have to figure out how long it will take to burn the rice this time...). Definitely recommend this oven.|pos
PLEASE read the reviews, it could save you time, money and frustration.  I also bought a GE Microwave - Cafe thought it would be a quality product because I paid over $400.00, it also started dying after the first year, the magnatron, which has a five-year warrenty was corroded and had to be replaced at an additional $$ repair cost, part was free.  One day after the 30 day repair warrenty the microwave  totally died -$800 +.  Repair failed to come during appointed time, in fairness they later said they had called and rescheduled, but I had no message on my phone so I waited for 4 hours.  The manager I spoke to was willing to have me wait another five hours on another day, that's the best they could do.  So if you want to throw your money away and get poor service, definitely buy GE products!|neg
THIS IS AWESOME! LOVE IT! IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL! COOKING AND DEFROSTING IS VERY WELL! AND THE SHIPPING WAS EARLY! VERY HAPPY OVERALL!|pos
Beware. I bought this over the range microwave in March of 2009, and it stopped working completely yesterday (Feb 25 2010). I use it once or twice per day. Normal stuff like TV dinners. It looks very nice, but it was NOT built to last.  I bought it online and I'm hunting through my archived e-mails trying to find my receipt so that I can get it serviced (preferably REPLACED). Earliest appointment is in a week, so I am without a microwave for at least a week.|neg
This microwave has more features than ANY other on the market...and aesthetically it is a work of art!  When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3½ years and if we were lucky, we got 2½ years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!    Below is a recap (of the items I could remember) of our Whirlpool adventure:    Microwave Purchased - 9/7/07  Warranty Issues:  6/23/08 - Glass turntable shattered when sizzle pan was heating, LCD display issues  7/1/08 -- Service Call - Parts ordered  7/17/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/11/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  8/18/08 - Replaced several parts, issue not resolved - Parts ordered  9/4/08 - Replaced 17 parts - Issue resolved    Extended (3rd party) Warranty:  1/29/2009 - No display on LCD, unit non-functional  2/?/2009 - Replaced Control board, connector  12/14/2009 - Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running.  Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.

The Microwave works beautifully.  The installation instructions left something to be desired, but we figured it out.|pos
[[ASIN:B002X7669C GE JES0736SPSS Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave Oven]  Quick review: Totally satisfied after 8 months of moderate use. Excellent value.    My wife and I looked at every small (-1 cubic ft) microwave at all prices before choosing this one. We have a very small kitchen in our condo and counter space is at a premium. We've had this unit for 8 months and it has performed flawlessly with daily moderate use. We use it mostly for baked potatoes, leftovers, popcorn, defrosting, etc, so we haven't subjected it to heavy use. Although it's only 700 watts, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time (2 medium potatoes in 9 minutes). The black/stainless steel casing and classic styling appealled to us also. Our dinner plates fit on the turntable with just a little room to spare.    At this point, I don't think we could be more satisfied with our purchase ($69.95 at Lowes), especially since we considered models 3X the price. Our previous microwave was a space-hogging Montgomery Ward monster we got as a wedding present 25 years ago (thank Gods it finally died) We'll see how this diminutive new GE holds up. I will update this review if we have any issues with it as time goes by.|pos
This black LG over-the-range microwave is just what we needed!  It arrived in good condition with clear directions and fits perfectly.    We're happy customers!|pos
We bought this, from Amazon, in July.  No issues.  Installed it and it worked great--for less than 4 months.  The microwave stopped working 3 days before Thanksgiving.  Called factory service, 2 weeks.  The appointment is scheduled for 8-12.  They show up at 11:55.  They stay until 2:00--yup it's broke, but we need parts and 2 people.  2 more weeks, parts are shipped to our house and service calls to confirm they are here.  (Factory service that doesn't have parts--interesting way to do business!)  They show up at 11:58--seriously.  Two hours (and another vacation day burned) and the replacement parts are defective.  (Warm fuzzy--not!)  Two more weeks--and they canceled their appointment.  Seems it takes two people to install it and the wonderful factory service only scheduled one.    So the top of the line microwave with convection oven will spend Christmas in the garage.  My newly remodeled kitchen a gaping hole with metal mounting plate for all my guests to admire.    I have e-mailed Whirlpool--will update if and when we get this very frustrating and disappointing mess resolved.    Thinking of buying this brand/item--save yourself--don't!      Update 12-28-09:  Well they canceled their appointment to fix it again.  They now have us waiting another 2 weeks before they can get someone to try and fix it.  Whirlpool customer service contacted us and said the only option we have is to get it fixed, they will not replace their defective equipment.  So it is still sitting in my garage waiting for someone to show up.      The great news is Santa did bring me a microwave to sit on my counter just in case my hopes that the repairmen soon will be here wouldn't happen.  It is a Sharp.  Bare bones model but it works! Santa is a wise man!    Oh--and where will my Whirlpool microwave be spending New Year's?  The garage.    February 28--after 5 more appointments--2 of which they failed to show Whirlpool agreed to replace the microwave.  We have the new one 3 days.  I do enjoy this microwave, I have my fingers crossed it will be reliable.      If you have problems, keep good records, stay with factory authorized service and be persistent.|neg
Just like with the previous reviewer, this microwave worked well until it didn't work at all.  It started turning itself on and then the keypad stopped working.  Since we had bought the house with the microwave, we didn't have the  info we needed to return it but on the instruction manual, the previous owner wrote that it was installed in 2008 and the oven stopped working at the end of 2009.  The manufacture date on the unit said December 2007 so it was less than 2 years old.|neg
This model performed as to be expected... it adequately heated items. After just over one year it suddenly suffered a short and started starting by itself. Additionally, the control pad stopped working. We temporarily overcame the problem by leaving the unit unplugged until needed and it then only sometimes functioned. Perhaps the old adage is correct in you get what you pay for.|neg
I am changing my five star to a one star review.<br /><br />The product cooked food well, but despite gentle use (we read reviews here noting a cracked door), our door has cracked, then cracked again, and then the handle itself has snapped off.  The material quality is very poor.  We were very gentle with this unit, but it's simply a very low quality product.<br /><br />Absolutely do not purchase this.|neg
We installed Sharp model KB6524 in June 2009 during a kitchen remodel. Every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model. This microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way. One of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it. It is also nice that the door slides open and I can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down. I liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open. I was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break. However, it seems that Sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem. I was also concerned that it didn't have a piece in it that rotates the food. So, we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots (note: I only use my microwave for reheating...not cooking). I LOVE this microwave. I had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that I would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24. So far, this has been the perfect size. It is even tall enough that I can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea. Also, my lovely daughter did not know that you can't put metal in the microwave. She put her fork in with her plate. Surprisingly, the microwave did not arch. We checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat. Not sure how they do it, but I'm not likely to try it. The microwave seems fine after the fork episode. This microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream. It asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate. It's a nice feature but I'm not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream. Just a portion of a tub. One other feature I use frequently, pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments. As an example, pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes. This is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience. I highly recommend this microwave!|pos
This is the neatest microwave I have ever worked with. It does everything for you. The controls are easy to use and very easy to see. I can not say enough about the guy we purchased this from. He went above and beyond to make sure we got the microwave before we left town driving from Ca. to OR to meet me.|pos
I purchased this unit to replace a Sharp R-2110JW Smart Carousel which proved to be a piece of junk. What a contrast! For about the same price this unit is much higher quality. The controls are well thought out. The door is designed with the window built in. The Sharp has a plastic overlay glued on that fell off after a couple months. The wall mounting was very easy and straightforward. Overall I couldn't be much happier! LG has won a convert!|pos
This microwave came with our new house.  It started making noises and is now smoking. What happened to microwaves that last??|neg
I have had this microwave for 1 year now, it has broken 3 times and Sharp has been terrible about getting it fixed under the warranty.  Opening / shutting the drawer is very sensitive & therefore the drawer stops working.  No turntable which means you need to manually spin your food around as needed.  Overly complicated directions.  Too expensive for what you get!|neg
This Sharp Microwave is Great for a Family. Its Large size is a big plus.  Easy operation and nice finish and very powerful.   We had an LG oven before and it is a JUNK ! It lasted only 2 years.  Our old Microwave was a Sharp also and its still working after 20+ years!  My rating A+++|pos
This microwave is wonderful. The quick heat buttons are convenient and easy to use. If you read Consumer Reports, it says this (or similiar) microwave has only a useful space of 0.9 cubic feet. Not so. This has a full 2.0 cubic feet of space which is great for cooking a ham or a large casserole dish. Very sharp design, useful and adequate lighting underneath. For the installation/do-it-yourselfers: It's 60 pounds and you have to lift it above your shoulders if you are installing over a stove. Follow the instructions to the letter, and all will turn out great. The directions are very good. Note: If you can, remove your stove before installing the microwave. The mfgr doesn't mention this, but it made things a lot easier (and I got to clean under it!)...2-3(-3 preferred) people are definitely needed to install this safely due to its weight and awkward size. I recommend this microwave highly!|pos
great microwave at great price.  i bought one from amazon.com last month for $199.  it arrived in one week.  no shipping charge.  looks great.  works great.  installed easily.  (professionally installed for $65.)  nice clean lines.  easy to operate.  hit the button once for one minute.  hit it again for each additional minute.|pos
We are very pleased with the Sharp Microwave.  It works very well,  has easy to follow directions and looks great.|pos
I love this microwave. It was worth waiting for. I had ordered this microwave from 4 other companies that said they had it in stock and then called to tell me they were backordered.Amazon delivered. Thanks|pos
I have never owned a convection oven before. I love it! Living in the south and only cooking for 2 people, why heat up the whole kitchen!? It's so easy to use. I bake everything in it now. I also use most of my Pampered Chef stones in it for even easier clean up!|pos
Bought the Sharp R-1874 in November 2006 and immediately noticed that the entire unit appeared to be of flimsy construction.  Now the door will not seal properly and it will only work in the micro or convection mode if the user continually keeps pressure on the latch.  A ridiculous situation.     Sharp USA was no help and a repairman gave me a $230 quote to fix it.|neg
I am very disappointed at the poor reliability of this unit.  Ours is less than a year old and has failed--now, when attempting to cook, the unit shuts off before the end of the programmed time.  Even though the light comes on and the turntable turns, the unit does not heat food.  Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.  A quick search on the web now reveals that GE microwave ovens are not reliable--many others appear to have similar problems with the magnetrons.    Perhaps this is one reason why GE is looking to sell its appliance business...|neg
E. J. Tastad's review of this product is accurate and appropriate, but I would like to add some additional information.  I bought this GE Profile microwave oven in March of 2006 on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  In September 2009 I am sorry to report that I had to throw it out because it wasn't worth repairing.  Consumer Reports gave this GE model their top rating for large microwave ovens.  It replaced an old Amana RadarRange that I had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames.  The Amana had also received Consumer Reports top rating back then.  If I recall, my Amana sold for about twice as much money (in 1981 dollars) as this GE costs in 2006 dollars.<br /><br />Since this microwave oven is more powerful, faster and consumes more electricity than small models, you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use.  Compared with my old Amana, the GE has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating, probably because the food is rotated on a turntable.  As E. J. Tastad found, the defrost cycle is easy to use, gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive.  The stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean.<br /><br />Unlike my old Amana, this oven cannot multi-task.  For example, if you're running the built-in clock timer, you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions.  You must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa.  You also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old Amana could accommodate, nor can you program it to start at a later time.<br /><br />This microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old Amana did.  The magnetron tube in my GE Profile microwave oven failed after two years of use.  It's replacement was covered by the five-year GE warranty on the tube, but the warranty didn't cover the $85 in labor charges, which would have been even more if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.  After 3 1/2 years of use, (September 2009) the main circuit board self-destructed.  It cost me $44 at the nearest GE repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another $200 to replace the microwave oven's circuit board.<br /><br />Since other brands of similar-sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs, I have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1/2 years and after spending $129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price.  Given this experience, I now be hard-pressed to recommend this appliance considering its cost-of-ownership and short life.  This appliance should have lasted much longer.  It did not get heavy use and was never misused or abused.<br /><br />When I contacted GE about my failed microwave oven, they promised to make things right, asked for the model and serial number and requested that I cut off the appliance's power cord and plug and send it to them.  They then sent me a $100 rebate check that could be applied ONLY to another GE appliance purchase.  The check expired before I found another GE appliance that I wanted to own.<br /><br />I bought a replacement, which was a Panasonic model NN-SD978S microwave oven for less than $200 from Sam's Club.  It is just as large, cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable.  After four years, it's still going strong without need for repairs.ore if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.

This appliance works much better than my last sharp. As for noise complaint I didn't find it to much different than my old microwave. Only bad part about stainless steel is that you see all the fingerprints everywhere. Really liked the speedy service.|pos
Pros:<br />Large<br />Fast and Even Heating<br />Great Defrost<br />Not too loud<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sensor reheat is only good for soups and other substance that it is okay to heat to boiling (don't trust it with Pizza, or other foods like that).<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This is an excellent large microwave for countertop use.  The inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time, never cooking my food more than it should, but the reheat is a gimmick.<br /><br />This is a large countertop microwave, at about 2.2 cubic foot.  Coming from an over-the-range microwave this is a huge improvement in size.  The microwave heats uniformly and fast (it is 1200 watts).  The sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil, otherwise it overcooks about everything else.  It also works best when you lightly cover the food, as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early.  Lightly covered is critical, as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product.  If the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated.  Sensor cook should also only be used under supervision (you should be in the same room).<br /><br />I have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue.  It is no louder than other microwaves I have used, and the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  You do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking.  My favorite feature is the inverter defrost.  Remember you enter the weight in pounds, so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1/2 of a pound.  If you had a 1.5 pound package of meat, you would enter 15 and start for 1.5 pounds.  The display shows the weight correctly. Not much else to say about the product, it is a microwave after all.<br /><br />Update: To improve sensor reheat performance, use a lid over the food with a vent hole.  I use a paper plate with a small hole (finger tip size) punched in it.  This will make sure the reheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.  It has been no issue and still works perfectly.  I use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles, and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods.  I also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags.  Everything has been working great!<br /><br />Update (7/26/2011): Still going strong.  I use the inverter regularly for defrost, or lowering the power level to cook something slower.  It has worked well for me, and I think problems might be from shipping, quality control, or some other factor.<br /><br />Update (3/21/2013): Still going strong, but maybe a bit noisier now.  No issue with inverter function or anything.eheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.

After too much research, I settled on this terrific microwave.  Every brand of microwave seems to have a malfunction-no help horror story. So in the end, if you chance having a microwave at all, this one seems better than most, if not all.  It works splendidly without any problem with noise or mechanical parts. My experience with Sharp Carousels has been 5 stars.  At home and work they have been dependable, efficient, good looking, and inexpensive.  Both the 2.0 and 1.4 cubic foot Carousels are commodious enough for large casseroles. When I designed my kitchen twenty years ago, I made two below-counter cabinet spaces to tuck in a medium and a large countertop microwave. I bought Carousels and have used them simultaneously almost daily.  They have been great workhorses.  The smaller one lost some of the digital display to no effect a few months ago, then made nasty little arcing noises last week and promptly was sent out to pasture. Last year I bought new stainless steel appliances (including Bosch dual fuel slide-in range-- the dream machine), and so I chose the stainless steel Sharp R-408LS Carousel 1.4 cubic foot/1100-W with a 14 inch turntable from BJ's ($99) as a replacement. The match with the other appliances was so good that I replaced the 2 cubic foot/1200-W with Sharp's R-520KS microwave as well. The display pads are lightly different, but better than losing size in the 1.4 cu. ft.  The Carousels match the Bosch oven door design remarkably, including the rounded window corners.  My kitchen looks better than when it was totally new with this addition. Knowing that these two new appliances are untried in the long term, I can only say they are 5+ stars as week-old additions to my kitchen. The microwaves do everything I want powerfully and quickly. The cost, especially with Amazon Prime shipping, closed the deal.|pos
For the price I don't think you can beat this Sharp microwave.  I just wanted a basic microwave that did the job.  I was replacing a countertop micro that was rated at 1200 watts and I was concerned that the rated 950 watts of the Sharp would be inadequate.  My fears were groundless as the Sharp functions every bit as fast the older one.  I like the sleek appearance without a protruding door handle.  They recommend two people to mount this oven, however since I didn't have help available I was able to easily mount it myself with a little thought.  If I were to rate it down for anything it would be that the mounting instructions are confusing in a couple of areas, mainly in the venting info.  All-in-all a good buy.|pos
I feel that there is a design flaw in this product. The SENSOR REHEAT button it just below the STOP CLEAR button and very easy to push by mistake. This very thing happened to our Microwave oven on January 27 2008, after a few minutes we could smell burning plastic, I ran into the kitchen and found the microwave smoking and after unplugging the unit I found that the door seal had a melted hole in it. I feel that an automatic feature like SENSOR REHEAT should not be an AUTO DESTRUCT! This could have become a very serious situation by starting a fire or having melted plastic stick to someone. I did not have the original receipt because it was a gift in 2007 and it is not worth paying the shipping charge to send it back, I wanted to inform you of this dangerous condition. We have replaced the microwave with another Sharp R402JK without the SENSOR cook, we have always liked sharp products and it is sad that this unit failed to live up to the Sharp reputation From Sharp Minds come Sharp Products  Sharp refused to honor the warranty saying that it was a consumer fault  by running the microwave with nothing in it. I feel this is a very dangerous flaw, you can just lean against the control panel and the unit will start up and run untill it melts.|neg
You will be surprised at the amount and size of food this oven will accomodate.  It cooks everything from meatloaf to pound cake evenly and locking in juices.  I bought this because my other Sharp over the range microwave gave up after eleven years of constant use.  I was used to the Sharp features which made it the logical choice.  At the same time, I wanted to replace my conventional oven (also 11 yrs. old) because it never baked evenly.  With the Sharp micro/convection combo, I no longer have to replace my conventional range oven - I'll use it for storage.|pos
We purchased this itme for a family member for Christmas. They love it. Said its the best microwave they ever had. They love the one touch features as well as the large cooking area. Would recommend if you want a dependable and spacious microwave.|pos
I bought the Sharp R-520KS Microwave to replace my old White Westinghouse that stopped working after Thanksgiving.  I did alot of research before I bought this one.  I was worried I wouldn't find a microwave that worked as well as my last one.  The good thing is that I could finally replace my white microwave with stainless steel to match the appliances in my new house.  Now I had an excuse to replace it.  I was looking for a powerful 1200 watt microwave large enough to fit large dishes in, and this one had some of the best reviews, a decent price, and the stainless steel look I wanted.  I also needed a counter top model since I have no under cabinet space to put one.  This microwave works great!  I also like how the control panel doesn't have elevated buttons making it easy to wipe clean with no chance of food or anything getting stuck in the buttons.  It has some nice features like the hot water button (you tell it how many cups to heat), minute plus button, keep warm setting, and many others.  I've probably used the hot water and minute plus features the most.  There are sensor heating buttons, reheat buttons, and defrost buttons, although I haven't had a chance to use them as much yet.  The ones I have used so far work great!  My only minor complaint is the same as everyone else's, the buttons all look the same and the start/minute plus button and stop/cancel button are located in the midst of all the other buttons making it difficult to distinguish them quickly.  Not too much of an issue, but it would have been nice if those features were located on the bottom or the corner of the display and were different than the others.  It wouldn't keep me from purchasing this microwave since everything else is great and I'm sure I'll get used to them soon.  The microwave is also pretty large, so you can fit alot in there.  I've heated a cup of water and a dinner sized plate of food at the same time.  All in all, this microwave works great, looks great, and was reasonablypriced.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice looking, powerful, counter top microwave.|pos
We got this through Amazon and have been very pleased.  I do recommend that you open the box and inspect immediately upon delivery, especially if it is during the holiday season when shippers use a lot of inexperienced people. Our first unit's box externally seemed fine but the interior packing was pulverized and the unit was obviously busted up.  Amazon replaced it and our second unit is still running strong.     I love this - I could write a tome.  The convection oven not only bakes and roasts, but setting at 100 degrees, I use it for raising bread, and 150 degrees, I'll bring a steak or roast up to room temp before searing and cooking. I think at 150 degrees it's faster and safer than having it sit on the kitchen counter as recommended in my cookbooks. I'm a better cook!    One warning about a dual-use appliance like this, which should be obvious: when you are using it for one thing it is not available for the other.  I wouldn't want to be without this unit, but I also have another microwave and I feel I need both. I would say I use the two, in tandem, nearly every evening.|pos
this was a great buy!! I read the other reviews and they are right on the money. Easy to put up but it goes easer with two people but one can do it and everything you need is their and it works great.|pos
I never got to use this microwave oven because the door would not stay shut.  I had to send it back.  Darn.  Amazon was very helpful and took care of my problem.  I am pleased with Amazon's service.|neg
Earlier Sharp microwaves have been great, but this model beats the others we've had in features and speed--and this newer model cost a lot less. We haven't yet used all the features this microwave affords, but  we know we're going to be saving a lot of cooking time|pos
This Oven is GREAT. It'll cook anything and fast too. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for most of the time. This time I did. Stick a hot dog, or some potaoes or bacon in there and push the right number and presto you have cooked food. We had baked chicken the other night and it was brown, done and tasty. I love the darn thing. I give it a high five.|pos
Love it! Love it! Love it!  My Sharp microwave of 10 years finally died.  It had survived numerous moves and the door was actually held on by strapping tape.  We looked around at other microwaves and found we couldn't beat the price for all the features offered by this model from.  This one was built with the same quality as my old one and I don't doubt it will last as long.|pos
My Sharp convection  over the range mirowave is perfect. Other brands have a protruding handle, {could hit tall people in the face} the handle on my new Sharp is flush and much more stylish. My husband installed it, the instructions were great. Sharp has designed the shipping box to be used as a lifter and holder to assist the installer.  <br />The best thing was the excellant service from Amazon, and I saved over $200. Thank you Amazon and Sharp!!!!|pos
We really like this microwave but more we like how easy it was to get it from Amazon.  It really has a good convection oven, although is somewhat noisy with the fan.  It was very easy to install and came with very clear instructions.  Amazon delivered it quickly and it was the best price as anywhere.|pos
I have had two of these. Both of them had the LCD Display fail and the plastic buttons crack, warp and other wise fail as well.|neg
This is a great microwave, especially with the $25 discount Amazon is offering on kitchen purchases over $125. But let me tell you why this purchase was extra special. I was concerned about buying a microwave that had to be delivered (size, weight, fragile, etc) rather than from a local store .  But the selection at local stores like Best Buy was so bad, I placed the order. Unfortunately, the day it was supposedly delivered by UPS, no microwave arrived. I called UPS to see if I could start a tracer, but UPS told me that Amazon had to start the tracer because they sent the package. I went to the customer service site, couldn't find a phone number, and used the e-mail system. I thought - great - that e-mail will disappear into the ether, I may never hear from anybody, and here I am without my microwave.  That was about 8pm local time when I sent the e-mail. <br /> <br />The next morning when I checked my e-mail, I got quite a surprise. An Amazon rep wrote back, apologized my package had been lost, and re-ordered the item for me. Before too long, I had an e-mail the item was already shipping via 2-day delivery, and sure enough, 2 days later I had the replacement package. Wow! No hassle, no waiting, just great service. I couldn't believe it. I don't think I'll ever hesitate when I want to order something from Amazon again. I don't work for Amazon, they're not paying for this - I've actually never written a product review before. I was just so impressed with the customer service, I had to write. <br /> <br />The final chapter - the day before the replacement microwave arrived, the person who lives in the next cul-de-sac over from us, with the same house number, and with a street name similar to ours, showed up with the original microwave that UPS had mistakenly delivered to them. I wrote Amazon customer service an e-mail, and once again after a very quick response, I was able to arrange for UPS to come pick up the extra package.  Thanks Amazon.  You're great.|pos
I was a bit put-off by other reviews critical of packaging, delivery, installation problems, and quality.  In my case at least, Amazon and Sharp scored 100% in all categories.  I do find that a small hydraulic jack helps immeasurably when single-handedly positioning the unit during installation. And the manual was misleading regarding exhaust fan orientation.  It's often the case that manual updates lag product improvements.|pos
I bought this on Amazon to replace a Sharp microwave, which has served me well for several years. Based on the price, compared to other with similar features, this unit is the least expensive. I was also impressed with the comprehensive directions for installation. I am closer to being Tim (the toolman) Taylor than a professional at home improvements, so I followed the instructions with precision. The results were outstanding. Not only does it look GREAT where my old stove hood used to be, it passed my popcorn test, of which, I am particular. No scotching, full bag, satisfying and an extra plus, while I am beaming over my accomplishment, the beep sounds indicating the popcorn was finished, the display read Enjoy. Am I ever! I have in my digital locker,courtesy of Amazon, my own .pdf manual. What a great investment in money for the microwave and the time for installation of the unit.<br /><br />Solidly built, looks great, came with lightbulbs for range light INSTALLED! No cons, but could have used some help with installing, as the manual recommends 2 people install, but I did manage nicely by myself. I would suggest an additional set of hands for final insertion, once preparations are complete. I have only owned this for a day, but, I wanted to tell my tale to give others an incentive, if they are on the edge, to jump at this opprotunity to snazz up the kitchen in a big way and for little out of pocket.<br /><br />Panasonic wants like $300 for a comparable unit. I am pleased to pay 1/2 as much and get a quality unit such as this. You can even get this for $25 off before January 31st, free shipping (this dude is HEAVY!) and no tax, do the math, it is a steal!|pos
One week after installing this over-the-stove, convection microwave, the stainless steel interior began to look spotted. A white cloth rubbed on the area revealed rust which continued growing like a severe rash on all surfaces of the inside. Sharp authorized a local service rep to make a housecall and examine it. He concluded the metal interior's defect, whereupon Sharp said they would replace (but not pay for reinstallation of) the unit. Removing the defective microwave and reinstalling will cost me $140!!! That wipes out any savings incurred by ordering online. Sharp's customer service will not compensate. I would have been MUCH better off buying from my local retailer who would have changed out the piece without charge in a situation like this. Live and learn. It is more than one month after the inspection and I have not received the replacement (said to be on back-order but still available online!!!).  <br />Aside from the interior cosmetic defect, the microwave looks great and works fine.|neg
I see many disgruntled people who have had shipping problems. Sharp  does not put enough packing materials in the box to ship these VIA Post-Office or UPS. At 85 lbs The seller needs to Double Box these and add more packing material and then send via FED-EX or DHL at a higher ground rate and customer will be fine. Thanks <br />thecloseoutking|pos
I ordered one of these on line. It came in promptly. I found that it was bent on the bottom, bent on a piece of stainless steel across the front and the vent damper that came inside the oven was damaged. This appeared to be a factory sealed unit. <br />It had to come from the factory like this. Possible the bottom was bent somewhere in shipment ranging from the factory to the shipper. Since I got it on Friday, I went ahead an installed it thinking that Sharp would simply send me the parts as they were screw on simple replacement parts. I was wrong. First Sharp said they did not warrant cosmetic damage. I told them it was factory shipped that way, please send parts. They said NO! Ship it back to who I bought it from. I, after much argument, had to take it down and send it back. This ended up costing the seller shipping charges which they paid. I felt this was not right as Sharp could have easily fixed the problem. The shipper did not have another unit in stock, so I got a refund and ended up buying another brand locally. The foam in bottom of carton was very thin (none in middle), thus, subjecting the unit to shipping damage. I had a Sharp before this one that never gave any real problems, but their customer service really sucks!  <br /> <br />My advise to you is to carefully check ANY microwave oven you buy before you leave the store or install it. Apparently the factories in USA or Korea do not do this before they ship them. <br />I finally got my replacement oven installed, but it was the third unit to get one that was not bent right out of the box.|neg
It may look pretty, but as an over the range microwave oven it provides nothing but headaches. Even a modest amount of heat from the cook top below causes the microwave oven's pushbutton door latch to deform (melt?) because Sharp chose to save money with plastic rather than metal interior parts. Thus, either the door won't close or one has to pry the latch open each time. The service technician who replaced the assembly (twice) said he had performed almost a dozen similar replacements in the recent past. <br /> <br />My advice, buy it only if you never plan to use the cook top below. <br />|neg
I purchased this item for two reasons, 1) because this is a Union Made microwave assembled in TN (the only American made microwave I've found)  and 2) It has a convection oven that can double as a 2nd oven.<br />The styling on this unit is very nice, sleek and not overcomplicated, it enhances the look of my kitchen.<br />The microwave cooking is simple, with built in functions for thawing frozen items or popping popcorn, etc.  You punch a button, it asks you how many steaks you are defrosting or how much popcorn you are popping and it does the rest.<br />Convection cooking is new to me, but the manual and recipe booklet that come with the unit have already produced salmon steaks with a white wine/basil sauce and cooked a pizza.  I've found that in the heat of the summer I can use this oven vs. my gas oven and it cooks faster and doesn't heat up the house as much.  There is also a function that combines microwave and convection cooking to get meals done even faster... there are so many things this machine does, I've yet to figure them all out.<br />A nice feature, you can turn the turntable on/off depending on whether you have a round or rectangular dish.<br />The unit runs on regular 110 voltage, so no complicated rewiring.<br />GE, Kenmore and Samsung all have similar units -all made in Korea, all for the same price or more. I chose this microwave because I was tired of complaining about outsourcing of American jobs and wanted to support a company like Sharp that is still making some of their units here in the USA.|pos
