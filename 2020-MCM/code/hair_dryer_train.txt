I work in a beauty shop and it is wonderful it does everything I need it to do and more.|pos
Got this for a trip to Italy.  It packed easily and took up minimal space.  You still need the plug adapters for it but it worked great while on the trip.|pos
Heats up fast, cools down quick. No waiting or anything, great product. It really worked on my wet curly hair|pos
I found it ideal as a travel hair dryer. It's small size fits into my shaving kit, but it also surprised me just how powerful it is, to dry and style wet hair.|pos
This was on my daughters Christmas list as a priority item. She is a hairdresser and swears that this blow drier cuts 20 minutes off her styling time. She was thrilled with this blow drier!|pos
I have purchased two of these units.  First one lasted a year before burning out.  Thought it was the way my wife was using it that was the problem so I purchase another one and it now it is an expensive night light.  It shuts off when using and she cannot completely dry her hair.|neg
This hairdryer works great and is at a great price point. I don't have any complaints on it, but will warn people that the cord is a little shorter than usual.|pos
Has three setting on both the heat and on the blower and let me tell you, the highest settings are hot and powerful! This is a fantastic styling tool, comparable with my stylists dryer for sure! I highly recommend this dryer. AND IT'S ANIMAL PRINT!!! BONUS!|pos
I don't have much insight for the hair dryer's performance as it was a Xmas gift for my wife but her feedback-in-a-nutshell to me was &#34;I Love It!!&#34;.  After exhaustive research on my part to find the best hair dryer at a given price point, I settled on the Onei MK-II based purely on the Amazon reviews and it apparently paid off.  (BTW, she has very fine, blonde hair).|pos
I love this hair dryer! It has more settings than I am used to. I love the adapter pieces. I styled it with the styling tip and it looked like I got my hair done at the salon.|pos
Its a great hairdryer. Its much less noisy than some of the  others. It motivated me to go out and purchase another blow dryer to replace the cheap Walmart brand that I had bought before. It seems to do a good job drying my hair even though, its hard to tell because I do not have very much hair|pos
Excellent product.|pos
I like how much air and heat this hairdryer puts out. I have a ton of hair that takes ages to dry, but that time is much shorter with this hairdryer.<br /><br />The only downside is that I wish the cord was longer! My old hairdryer had a much longer cord and I was spoiled by it.|pos
This is my first time purchasing a hair dryer instead of a hand held one. I really like this product, dries hair fast and I can sit comfortably while waiting....the downfall is not being able to hear the television while hair is drying, however it gives me time to check out magazines or read a book while waiting. It is big, so I store it in my closet, luckily I have a walk-in.|pos
This product is just perfect for the teen I purchased it for...she's really in to primping and this saves time and is easy to use! Love it!!|pos
Three speeds (noise) and two heat settings. My 4yr old no longer complains about blow dfying his hair cause of the queiter speeds. Great buy for yhe price.|pos
One of our daughters had this item on her &#34;wish list&#34;.  She was excited when she opened it.....very proud of her gift.  Appears to be of good quality and looks durable.|pos
I love this dryer. The cord system is super convenient.Easy to use for a reasonable price. Get it! you wont regret it.|pos
I really like this little hair dryer, and it is all that I really need.  I have long hair but it can be totally dry in 5 minutes with this unit!|pos
lightweight and fast drying, just what I wanted, excellent quality, good settings.  I like the longer cord, no need for an extension cord!|pos
I would not recommend this dryer since it only blows out cold air and takes me thirty minutes to dry out my hair.|neg
This was a definite Christmas favorite...great color, works great, has the cool styling attachment which was a hit!!!  My daughter loves it!|pos
mom will love this one. Don't need to hold with hand and easy to carry around the country and abroad|pos
I've used Conair dryers for years, but they share the same issue with other brands......the little mesh screen filter in the back gets easily clogged with dust, lint, and hair....causing the unit to overheat and eventually die.  I've tried everything to keep that little screen clean, including carefully brushing it with a small stiff brush....but then the particulates fall into the motor causing more problems or the lint and stuff just plain won't come off the filter.<br /><br />I just received this new dryer, to replace a Conair model from several years ago.  Conair FINALLY hired someone with some common sense!  I was surprised.....this unit has a REMOVABLE screen filter!  Which means I can take it off and WASH it (being very careful to insure it's totally dry before replacing on the unit, of course), extending the life of my unit.<br /><br />Big selling point in my opinion....removable filter info should be in the description.  Bravo, Conair, well done!|pos
I have used many many less expensive hair dryers over the course of 30+ years and they often break within a year.  I have had this dryer about two years now and it is still going strong.|pos
I'm not a professional but have naturally wavy hair which is prone to frizz and fly-away action.  This hair dryer is amazing.  It is heat controlled and not air controlled.  Instead of blowing my hair to dry it out, it gently blows heat at target area and dries hair faster, without wildness and frizz. My hair feels soft, is shiny and dries evenly.  It was worth the money and the time to wait for it to arrive.  But with Prime you'll get it pretty quick!|pos
Used on my 5 yr old with African American natural hair. Does a super job especially when used in combination with a smoothing serum. When I use this dryer I'm cool with delaying flat ironing. Just ponytail her up.|pos
This is all I had hoped it would be. It has great power and it is the nice compact small size I desired.|pos
Pleased with new blow dryer.  Dries hair, just as advertised.  Love the retractable cord.  Keeps my gym bag a little less messy.  Love the red.|pos
Hot setting should be changed to almost warm. Warm setting should be renamed cool. Same for blower settings. By the time this generates heat and air your hair will already be dry.<br /><br />Edit: After 60 days it has started making a grinding noise for about 15-20 seconds when first turned on. What next sparks?<br /><br />Into the trash.|neg
Product gets way too hot.  The attachment that comes with it does not fit snuggly.  Have used it 3 times since buying it and I am not pleased.  Seriously considering returning it.|neg
The matte finish was the first thing we noticed when we opened the hair dryer.  It is great - looks good and has a great - soft texture.  The temperature settings are low, med and high and it has a cool button for when you need a blast of cold air.  The fan can be set to low and high.  The fan moves lots of air.<br /><br />Even an 80's era, big hair band could save time with this product.  That kind of hair needs to be washed, rinsed, washed again and then heavily conditioned.  The conditioner softens the hair and forces it to accept massive amounts of water.  This increased water volume must be removed prior to styling or the hair will just sit there flat - like a poorly tuned guitar.  Pull the Conair 225NP from the holster, point it at the hair and get started.  The powerful DC fan moves lots of air to force its way into that mop head of hair and push the water out.  The three heat settings provide complete control over the speed of the drying process.  The entire band can share one 225NP and still be on the stage in time to rock the house!<br /><br />Medium heat and high speed fan gets hair dry fast with no friz.|pos
This dryer is every thing that it says it is! Quiet, professional looking comfortable to use and attractive on the wall. It is certainly a quality item and I would recommend it to anyone|pos
This is my second Portofino 6600.  My daughter and I have thick, long, curly hair.  This dryer cuts down the drying time by more than half.  The first is still going strong after two years of daily heavy use.  Also very pleased  with the diffusser and concentrating attachments.  This dryer has by FAR outperformed other well known brands costing two or more times the price.  I would do commercials for this dryer!|pos
I have one of these already and love it. Will make a great gift. It is powerful & the reel cord makes this blow dryer even better!|pos
After one month of use when I turned it on it made a terrible noise and plastic parts starting flying across the room. Vety dangerous. Piece of junk. Price should have been my first clue.|neg
My wife swears by this hair dryer and she is on her third unit. That may sound bad, but each one has lasted 5 years, so definitely seems okay for the price.<br />Lightweight, nice rubber grip, and not too loud.|pos
Mom was desperate for a new dryer even though she doesnt use the old one she has now.<br />But besides that this was a perfect upgrade.|pos
I got this dryer a couple years ago and use it quite frequently and it is still working great. I love the way the cord retracts and how the unit folds. It is great for travel but I use it as my main dryer at my boyfriend's house since it works so well. My hair is long and thick and this thing still gets the job done just as well as my full-sized hair dryer that I keep at home.|pos
I am natural with thick thick African American hair.  My hair goal is to get to waist length and don't like flat ironing my hair.  The last time I went to a salon, I came out smelling my hair like it was burned.  So I started looking for a blowdryer that will make my hair straight but not flat ironed.<br /><br />I did research and decided to try this.  God... I loveeeeeeeeeeeeee it.  I just finished blowdrying my hair and it looks just the way I wanted it.  Not too straight with some volume to it.  Ughhh.. Why didn't I buy this a log time ago?<br /><br />NOTE TO SELF: AFTER DOING RESEARCH, READ REVIEWS, QUICKLY BUY PRODUCT..<br /><br />Try this if you want to... you won't be disappointed...<br /><br />XoXo|pos
I always take my full size blow dryer even to nice hotels where I know they will have a blow dryer.  I decided to try this dryer and it really works.  It is so lightweight and I can't believe it can even dry my hair.  I only take it with me now.|pos
Love this hairdryer.  Not only does it dry my hair quickly, but the three heat settings mean that I don't have to rely on the hottest setting.  And, if you have fine hair,  it does not create static like some other hair dryers can do in cold weather.|pos
Love this hair dryer.  Cool, medium, high settings great...but the key is that it is LIGHT weight.  An ionic dryer without being my work-out also!  Shiny hair in quick time.  Why did I wait so long to buy a product that works?|pos
I've been using this dryer as my main hair dryer for the past four months and I love it. It is light weight and worked in both the US and the Middle East. I also like that the dryer came with the two attachments. The handle also folds in to save space on packing.  One thing I would point out to people looking at the reviews is that you will need a screw driver to change the voltage of the hair dryer. Just something to keep in mind depending on your use of the hair dryer. But I would definitely recommend this hair dryer to anyone needing a dual voltage or travel hair dryer.|pos
I love the folding handle & retractable cord. Compact & light. Still strong enough for blow drying a long hair.|pos
I love love love this hair dryer. Its fast and powerful. Gets the job done within 10 minutes for me.|pos
Just great. . And compacted.  A lot of power<br />Doesn't over heat... great for the price and for first time users|pos
Bought this unit for traveling to Europe, very compact for travel and with the dual voltage it's a plus.<br />But you'll still need an adapter for  the European receptacles, from the flat blade to the round one.|pos
This a great dryer, dries hair fast, no frizz main reason I bought., yes I would recommend this to anyone.<br />Haven't found anything I dislike.|pos
The best hair dryer, ever! Always leaves my hair straight with lots of body. I've had my first one for at least 7 years. I was trying to share it with my sister & her daughter. Now, I'm having my own daughter soon, so I gave my sister the first one & I bought another one.|pos
THIS PRODUCT IS SO WONDERFUL THAT I HAVE BOUGHT IN MULTIPLES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  I KEEP ONE IN EACH BATHROOM AND A SPARE IN THE LINEN CLOSET FOR REPLACEMENT USE!  VERY CONVENIENT.|pos
Whenever I buy a house i always install one of these in the master bathroom.  This is my 3rd one.  Very convenient, very strong, very hot,|pos
Love this item.  Easy to install.  Very easy to use.  Its always handy and easy to get too. Heat and air is perfect as far I am concerned.  Would highly recommend.|pos
I used this hair dryer while traveling this summer. It was used in the US, Canada and Italy. I was very happy with it. It folds up so it is compact and easy to pack but it is still very powerful for such a little hair dryer. I also appreciate the two attachments that come with it. And, the fact that you can switch it between 120V and 220V makes it incredibly convenient.|pos
This was a great purchase for me!  Dryer has great power and drying ability, very efficient!  I would highly recommend!  The item was exactly as described!|pos
I was finally ready to replace my 8-year old travel hairdryer  with something more powerful and quite, and yet just as light-weight. I have fine shoulder length hair with a tendency towards frizz.. I stumbled across the positive reviews for the Onei MKII while researching several other hairdryers (T3 featherweight, Elchim 2001 and BaBlyiss 2800). I chose the Onei based upon the great reviews, the 4-year warranty, and the price. I think this hairdryer is great. It is very quite, dries my hair in half the time, and feels like it will last. My hair feels great - not scorched like with my old dryer. If you are looking for a top-performing dryer, I would highly recommend trying this dryer first! The cool setting actually gets very cold, which is also  a great bonus for locking in curl and reducing frizz.|pos
Great dryer.  Nice heating controls, average weight.  I have had it for a few months and have been very happy with it.|pos
This is a great little hair dryer.  I like that it has three heat settings which are useful when wanting my hair to be straighter or have more curl.  I was hesitant about the retractable cord, but it works great and I have not had any issues with this dryer at all, Good purchase.|pos
This is by far the best hair dryer I have purchased.. I have thick long hair (past my waist) and it dries my hair quickly. Lots of airflow.. for the amount of power I feel it has its a plus that its much smaller then the dryers I've had.. I wouldn't say it was quiet but its not very loud.. it kinda hums instead of the high pitch whistling others have..And im in love with beautiful color and texture.. I bought another as a Xmas gift for my mother-in-law I know she will love it... The 4 yr warranty is a very nice bonus!|pos
Love this dryer, compared it with the SEdu 4000 and ended up returning the Sedu because it was much heavier and louder.  THis dryer is quiet, light, and I don't have to straighten my hair after. My hair is thick, wavy and frizzy. It also cut down my drying time about 5 minutes.  So glad I found it on Amazon after a very extensive search. And it was half the price of the Sedu!|pos
This item came fast and as of this writing, she hasn't opened the gift.  Looking forward to seeing her eyes on this item.  Thanks again.|pos
I bought two of these in March of 2011.  Within 12 months the first one died.  This morning, after 32 months of use, the second one caught fire in my wife's hand.  These are not a quality product and are even dangerous.|neg
I love the adjustable heat, I love the attachments and works and lasts for years! it was everything i could want in a hairdryer|pos
This hair dryer is EVERYTHING!! I absolutely love it!! I am African American and have very kinky hair. This dryer gets my hair straight and then I only have to run through my hair with the flat iron one time. I also use it for my daughter. She has loose curly hair and it gets her hair silky straight. LOVE LOVE LOVE this dryer!|pos
I'm a professional stylist. This dryer is powerful, it works great for any type of hair. The 2 nozzles give me options to how to distribute the air flow according to the density of the hair, I really like it! Great for professionals and personal use too. You can't go wrong with Twin Turbo, they are great dryers. Thank you.|pos
Have owned a few hair dryers and this one has definitely been my favorite.  Provides adequate fan power and heat while the overall design seems solid.  The cool setting provides a nice little gush of cooler air and the folding ability has been pretty handy (albeit mainly handy for going on trips).  The attachments it comes with also work pretty nicely and fit pretty snug.  Have had this for more than a year now with no problems as everything is still operating perfectly.  Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a solid and well priced hair dryer.|pos
Dries my long hair really quickly. Very lightweight. I like that it has several settings so I have choices on strength and heat level.|pos
This hairdryer Is similar to a blue Vidal Sassoon hairdryer (that I wrote a review about a few years ago) that seem to Not be available any more which Is easy to repair. This hairdryer Is 3 speed so the wiring Is more complicated than In the Vidal Sassoon. I have taken this hairdryer apart to clean and lubricate It, I take the back part off which has a metal screen Inside run In under the faucet with hot Water then I spray WD-40 In the motor doing that It will probably last forever. It has of get to burn out the fuse which I have bypassed a few times on the Vidal Sassoon but apparently there seems to be a piece  of plastic under to button to the switch which I lost taking It apart I put It back together and It worked right but had to use a small screw driver to turn In on and off with so I tried to modify It so that I did Not have to use a small screw driver now only high setting works. I have taken other hairdryers apart and could Not hardly put them back together this hairdryer goes back together fairly easy but It being 3 speed If You break some wires I do Not even want to think about It. I use hairdryers for many things as thawing out Water lines, defrosting the Freezer, defrosting the windshield on My Truck, pre heating the cab, dry out socks and shoes, putting under blanks when Its very cold this hairdryer has a round back which helps keep stuff from blocking off the Air flow and I have had hairdryers to burn out because of having a flat back and fall In to a chair with a blanket and burn out, and this hairdryer has a good automatic heat switch which prevents It from over heating but do Not ever leave a hairdryer under the blanket while You are sleeping or Not there.|pos
I absolutely love this dryer! It gets really hot on the highest setting which I prefer using because it will dry my hair faster. I like that it is adjustable and you can get a chair and slide it right over. Overall, it did the job of drying my hair and I'm satisfied.|pos
Bought one for our winter home also because its a great space saver and its extremely convenient to have it right at your fingertips.  Very powerful for a little dryer.|pos
Love this hair dryer! 2nd I've owned. First one I got on QVC- Amazon was cheaper to go for this one!  T3 is worth it for hair dryer- I know they r much more expensive- but worth the price. Drying time is less- cuts down on frizz.<br />I'll never go back to store brand!!|pos
I have been using this model for the last 10 years, it only been replaced for once.  It is beautiful, space save, powerful and very durable plus it has a night light.|pos
Can't get a much better hair dryer for this price. Have had no problems with it. My wife loves it and uses it all the time!|pos
I LOVE MY HANGING HAIR DRYER, I NEVER HAVE TO DRAG IT OUT OF A DRAWER AND PUT IT BACK IT IS ALWAYS THERE IT HAS A NIGHT  LIGHT BUT I USUALLY UNPLUG IT UNLESS I HAVE COMPANY THE LIGHT COMES IN VERY HANDY THEN IT HAS PLENTY OF AIR FOR BLOWING MY LONG HAIR AND I ALSO LIKE THE WAY I CAN HANG THE CORD UP|pos
To be fair, I cannot actually review the dryer itself. I received the dryer with the diffuser attachment missing, which renders it pretty much useless for me. I also received a black & purple dryer, which is not a big deal, but receiving an item that does not include attachments included in the description & a different color when it was not stated that colors may vary, makes me wonder whats happening in quality control. Frustrating.|neg
Bought one of these about six months ago from a big-box store.  Worked fine for 6 months, although thought it was pretty noisy and 'high' setting puts out a lot of heat.  Then, it started to apparently overheat when in use, resulting in the blower slowing down and no hot air coming out.  Looks like a thermo sensing switch failed.  You get what you pay for!|neg
No more tangled cord! Love this dryer. It is also pretty quiet for it's high wattage. I recommend this dryer.|pos
Love this hair dryer.  It takes less time for me to dry my hair. I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for an above average hair dryer|pos
Works like a charm! I love it! It does a great job for the money that I spent on it!|pos
I used this product at a Marriott Hotel and loved it. It has multiple settings, a directed air flow and seems to add volume to my hair. The retractable cord and folding handle are great for storage and travel. I would highly recommend this product to everyone.|pos
The one thing I do want to give them credit for is fast shipping. Now! on another note, the first bonnet I received came without the cord. I contacted the company and they immediately got back to me stating that they would send me another bonnet. Now the second bonnet really made me upset because it was damaged. The main thing that made me upset is how eager I was to get the purchase and both attempts failed. They replied stating they would send me out another one but I realized that if they couldn't get it together the first two times, I was afraid to see what the third would be. They need to reevaluate their packaging procedure for a more accurate outcome on products. I'm very disappointed and would never purchase from this company ever again. Never had an issue like this throughout my years of purchasing items through amazon!|neg
It was really loud, unnecessarily powerful for drying hair, my daughter was petrified of it and then it suddenly glowed red and started smoking!|neg
I've been using a John Freida 1875 watt dryer, which is heavy and tiring to use, because of my physical limitations.  I ran across this hair dryer, which I stored after buying the Freida.  The only reason I replaced it is because I was looking for a dryer with a cold shot.<br /><br />I used the dryer last night and it dries faster than the Freida 1825 watt dryer!  Since it's only 1200 watts, the dryer doesn't blow as hard.  It goes to reason that, since the air is not moving as fast, it will heat as well, if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a wall.  Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn't take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  Because of the decreased speed of the dryer, I had no problems with tangles, yet the time it took to blow my hair dry decreased by 1/3.<br /><br />My hair looked shiner last night than after using the Freida, which I attribute to the decreased wattage of the dryer. Also, the dryer is quieter than the Freida dryer.|pos
Love this hairdryer it is one of the best hairdryers I have ever used in my life!  I ordered this for a friend who had one already but I should have kept it for myself as a back up incase my ever died but I had it for about 3 years now and nothing went wrong yet!|pos
I love this blowdryer. It is light-weight and portable. I love how it folds up for when I travel. It is also super powerful and I can dry my long hair in just 5 - 10 min.|pos
Everything I want in a hair dryer.  Used the same model in a hotel I stayed out and had to have one for myself and one for my daughter.|pos
Great traveling Hair Dryer.  I used this when I went to Florida last month and it was so nice how it folds and the retractable cord was great instead of wining it around the Handle.|pos
My wife bought this, but I'll leave my two cents. This is a very quiet hair dryer. I figured that was something interesting that you should know. The air blows smooth and has a cool air button. The weight is about average and comes with two end pieces that I have no idea what they are for. Its a very nice hair dryer. The quiet factor with our sleeping baby is something I didn't expect.|pos
Excellent! Can't believe how smooth my hair is since using this dryer. Dries my hair in half the time. Love it!|pos
It's little, and it's POWERFUL, what more do you want from something called &#34;Mighty Mini&#34;?<br /><br />For all the reviewers that complain about the size and how &#34;cheap&#34; if feels, realize that you are buying something made for travel, and that it cost a whopping $20.<br /><br />This is a great hair dryer and suits my needs perfectly.<br /><br />If you want a bigger, more expensive one, then go find one elsewhere.|pos
I've only had this for about a week but I'm pretty impressed so far.  I had my old hairdryer for at least 6 years and it finally crapped out on me - it was just a Revlon that I had gotten from Walmart or somewhere.  I considered spending about $30 more on a nicer dryer, but decided I'd try a Conair first since it was cheaper and my mom has one that I love using when I go home.  So I ordered this guy (which came in two days - gotta love Amazon Prime when you don't have a working hair dryer) and was initially kind of bummed when I opened it.  I know you get what you pay for, but this one is much lighter than the dryer my mom has, so I was worried it wouldn't work as well.  Turns out my fears were unfounded - this guy is powerful and quieter than my old dryer, and the tourmaline ceramic technology, which they tout as leaving your hair shinier with less frizz, totally works!  My hair has been amazing every day.  I also really like how light it is now that I know it works.  I don't know how long this guy will last and I can see the matte casing eventually peeling off like the other reviewer mentioned, but it's functionality is fantastic for the price.  Would definitely recommend this.|pos
Used it at a hotel and had to have one. This is the best hair dryer I have ever used. Dries fast cuts drying time in half, and doesn't make my hair frizzy. Highly recommend it!!|pos
This was the first product I buy on amazon, the thing is heavy but it works amazing , is big but I won't change it for nothing!! The prize it's awesome comparing with what you can do with this thing, best thing it won't damage ur hair !|pos
Don't be fooled by its tiny size...it is so powerful! It dries my hair as fast and my big one! It's cute, convenient and efficient. I love it!|pos
Its just what I needed. Its a simple blow dryer but it works just fine for being so cheap. I like how its effective in the mornings after a long shower.|pos
I have thick, curly hair that I blow out every few days. This blow dryer has cut my drying time in half! The air force is STRONG with this one. Put it down on the bathroom counter and watch your hair ties and whatnot go flying. But it gets the job done, and incredibly well. My hair is *less* dry from this dryer, despite the high heat, and looks very healthy and sleek when blown out.<br /><br />WORTH IT!|pos
All the product I purchased from Blue Novelties thru Amazon were Christmas gifts for my girls. They were delighted and thrilled at the way the products worked. I'll be saving a lot of beauty salon cost from now on. I love shopping at Amazon.com and I have found a friend in Blue Novelties. Please email me a catalog so I can give it to them. Problem NOW is... they fight over the products.<br />...I can't win, no matter how much I try!  Thanx...Mr. Mac|pos
This blowdryer is a great product.  It is lightweight and dries your hair fast.  It is a super product for the price.|pos
I've had this hair dryer for at least 4 years, and although I did not purchase it from Amazon I am still reviewing the product itself.  My dryer is still going strong like the day I took it out of the box.  A few notes of caution:  1) keep the lint filter on the backside cleaned off or the air flow will be cut down.  Using an old toothbrush can help clean this off, 2) do NOT use the hottest setting.  As others have stated, it WILL fry your hair.  I had this problem several years ago and didn't realize my hair had fried because of the setting on the dryer, until my stylist looked at my dryer.  I use it on the medium setting and it works great.|pos
Great hairdryer. Works perfectly fine. It dries my hair in less than 5 minutes! My hais short but a bit thick.|pos
Small, powerful,easy to take on trips,..,occupies very little space, light weight, works in Europe with no hassle,easy to pack,attractive design|pos
Very strong wind produced by this hairdryer.  Dries my hair very fast, the cool setting defrizzes my hair after the wind tunnel dry:)  I have long thick hair and I can dry it in about 6-7 mins.  Great product ordered as a replacement after my old one (same hairdryer) died.|pos
Works great. Compact, portable, powerful. So far so good. Would purchase again. Purchased to replace an older model of same brand.|pos
Installed in guest room bath; and it's a nice extra that is convenient and out of the way.  Especially liked that the cord is not dangling!|pos
This is a small powerful hair dryer. It fulfills our needs very well and it has a cute color. Our 5 year old daughter can use it being so lite.|pos
I use this every day and they are the best hair dryer wall mount you are ever going to buy. Quality dryer that blows hot and hard enough to dry you hair very quickly and hang it back up and you are off and running. Anyone can mount it to the wall near an outlet and a mirror. I am on my 3 one over many many years and will not buy any other dryer when you can have this one to keep your life fast and simple and still looks good mounted on you wall.|pos
I love this blow dryer,because it get the job done,for less the price. I do a lot of natural hair and it smooth out that cuticle allowing me to Flatiron the hair smooth and straight.this it's the second one I bought.  One For Home And One For word. Love it.|pos
Great high quality hair dryer that works extremely well. Comes with a diffuser and all so it is great for even long, thick curly hair. Dries it quickly and overall it even looks like a very nice product as the handle material is very smooth with a good grip. Great value for purchase, would highly recommend.|pos
This thing died within a month of purchase. Bought it for the girlfriend to use when she visited. So it wasn't even everyday use for that month.|neg
I have a small bathroom, so putting the hair dryer on the wall is a great solution. It is at my fingertips!|pos
Works well. Perfect for travel. Compact, light weight, as good as any full size dryer. Pretty sturdy also. I'd recommend it.|pos
Heats up really quickly. Not sure if the ionic thing actually works or not, but it dries my hair fast.<br /><br />And as a guy, the black and gold design is nice. Not as embarassing as having a bright pink hair dryer.|pos
Awesome product!  Just what I wanted.  I have medium length, thick, curly hair that takes forever to dry, and was looking for a small blow dryer with a diffuser.  I wanted the blow dryer to double for daily use and travel, so my items can be useful in all ways and save space since I live in a small home.  When I first received the product and removed it from the box, I was skeptical about its ability to dry hair.  It looks like a toy.  However, it has two speeds which are comparable to other blow dryers.  It works great.  I use it every day.  I love the bag which is stylish and easily holds all the accessories plus the dryer without problems.  Finally someone who makes a storage bag where the product actually fits once the consumer uses it. (Unlike tents that you can never stuff back into the bag once you unpack them.) I loved this product so much I bought one for a gift.|pos
I love that this dryer is compact and really BLOWs the air at your hair.  I found this in a hotel and liked it so I looked it up and bought it from amazon.  Love the price, too!  I have a $150 dryer, which I really like, but it just doesn't blow the hair as strongly as I would like sometimes.|pos
The best blow dryer ever. 23 Afro American female I use with a long hard comb attachment and this makes blow drying so much easier because I have long thick hair and I hate doing it myself but this definitely helps out when I'm tryna save money but skipping the salon|pos
Bought for a trip to Europe; worked great with an adapter; no troubles. Small and easy to fit into luggage!|pos
Quality hair dryer, works perfectly. You do need to be careful to thread the cord through the bottom to get a tight fit against the wall. Runs and runs and runs forever, really.|pos
On and off switch broke after one week of using it.High heat was not that hot.When using it smelled as if something was burning.Would not recommend to buy.|neg
lasted for a few months and then crapped out would not be worth buying again only used it 4-5 times a month.|neg
This is everything I need in a hair dryer. I have medium-textured wavy hair, and the diffuser really helps make the most of my curls and waves. They turn out with great volume and shine (my husband says my hair is &#34;fluffy--but in a good way&#34;), and less frizz than I get with letting my hair air dry. Overall, the product does its job and I am very pleased.|pos
I took the hair dryer to Asia and while there, I put it on the 220 volt setting and plugged it in.  It worked good on the low fan speed, but, when I put it on high, the hair dryer smoked and immediately burnt up.  I had tested it in the USA on the 110 setting and it seemed to work fine.  This unit in my mind will not work in Asia without burning up.  It was either defective or not engineered to work on 220 volts.  My friend really needs a hair dryer in the morning and was not a happy camper when it burnt up.  I|neg
Great hair dryer!  I have short hair and can dry my hair in about 90 seconds.  It also is small enough to not take up too much room on the bathroom counter, and is light and fits well in my hand.|pos
Makes Blow drying so easy. I have very thick hair and the combs are sturdy. Easy to handle and does not get too hot.|pos
I got this for the wife. When I asked her after several months of usage she said it's great and work like a lot of high end blue dryer.<br /><br />For the price this is an awesome product.|pos
Well I had to put a 1 star on this because of the seller.  I hate to give the blow dryer a bad rating but I have no way to rate the seller any longer and I NEED you all to see this review!  This is my second Elchim dryer and my first one is still going strong after 7 years.  The one I purchased only 5 months ago from this seller, stopped blowing hot hair and according to Elchim...there is not much help because Amazon is not an authorized seller of Elchim.  I contacted this particular seller with no response (big surprise) and noticed just today that they changed their &#34;business&#34; name.  I noticed amongst the reviews that I am not the first situation like this.  The Elchim rep told me it is possible these are either not authentic Elchim dryers or they could possibly be selling them as refurbished.  I will have to pay to ship the dryer to Elchim so they can determine.  I will be doing this since I spent over $80 bucks on the dryer.  In a nutshell, save yourself from any hassles IF the dryer goes bad and buy directly from an authorized Elchim seller.|neg
Lightweight entry into the blowdryer category doesn't have enough oomph to blow even the finest hair dry. Low air pressure and low heat combine to make a lengthy process out of what ought to be a quick morning ritual.|neg
My wife loves it|pos
I needed a 2nd dryer to leave at a 2nd residence.  I liked the first one I bought 2 or 3 years ago and it still works fine, using it 7 days a week.  This is fairly Compact, the handle folds up, the retractor works well but I always guide the cord back into the handle when I retract it (if you let it zip closed I believe it places more wear on the rewinding mechanism).  It does get fairly hot, has a cooler setting, plus shot of cold air, not too loud, and comfortable to grip and use.  It would be nice if it had a 240 volt built-in converter but the cost was slightly under twenty bucks and many foreign hotels in the west have built=in converters in their hotel rooms.  I was very pleased with the first one, still up and running fine, and the new one is as good as the old one.  My wife also likes it as she has very thick hair which takes a long time to dry.  She says for an inexpensive hair dryer this does better than most and drys her hair in a reasonable manner.  A number of hotels like Marriott buy this Andis, and others that look almost identical, to place in their rooms.  One manager stated that he usually keeps several on hand as customers frequently ask to buy one|pos
I had this blow dryer it was awesome ! It leaves your hair amazing when using it on the last power ! I need to re buy this blow dryer ! I have really thick coarse hair with bangs this blow dryer made my hair super straight feels like right out of the salon !|pos
Busy mom has drying time cut in half, plus shinier hair. Only regret I have is not buying sooner! Also, it is quiet which is soothing to me and less intimidating to my littles on the occasion I dry their hair.|pos
Great product.  Wasn't sure if I could find one of these type hair dryers again.  It was requested by one of our senior residents that live in the residential facility I work at.|pos
good hairdryer - cheap, not too big, not too loud and lightweight. dries my hair quickly and it is powerful|pos
This is by far the best hair dryer you'll ever own. I have wavy, thick (not complaining), out of control hair that is usually best left to dry on its own. But this dryer straightens it without use of any additional hair products. I am impressed!|pos
This is great product.  I brought one for my sisters and mother.  They really love it.  I also put on in our RV coach.  I would recommend to everyone.|pos
Decided to buy this hairdryer based on what my hair stylist said. I always wondered why it seems faster to dry my hair at the salon than at home. She said something about ionic hairdryers that not only speed up the drying time, but takes away unwanted frizzy hair. She said to buy a ceramic brush as well to help with drying and to prevent frizzy hair. After purchasing this hairdryer and the right brush, I am able to dry my hair in 5 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes with a hairdryer bought at like CVS or Rite Aid. I have really thick, medium length hair. Where I live where it gets humid from time to time, my hair does get frizzy. After buying this hairdryer, time and frizz were no longer an issue. My husband even commented on how fast I have been able to dry my hair. I figured if he noticed, then I believe I made the right purchase. This hair dryer is a &#34;game changer&#34;. Definitely, helped me get ready for my day a lot faster.|pos
gave this as a gift & she loved it... it made her drying time half of what it was & she has long thick hair! thanks!|pos
I just got mine today and to test it I decided to do my sister's hair ! So When i open the box let me tell you I didnt expect it to be so small . However , according to the description it was said to have more power . I told my self I'll be the judge of that been that I had the twin turbo 3200  so I said this one should deff do better . So I did her hair & finished it very quickly actually  and I can say the hair was very shinny, the size did not have anything to do  with the power this blow dryer provided!!! So I am pleased with the results the hair was very soft and like glowy which never happened with the other dryer !|pos
so strong and dries well. love it! i have been using it for ever since but had no problems. :)|pos
My wife LOVED this hairdryer so much that she bought another when the first one sparked and died after several months.  Unfortunately, several months later, that one sparked and died.  Very disappointed!|neg
This little dryer is amazing.  Not only is it great for trips but for people with little strength in hands and shoulders.  My cousin just loves it.|pos
Infinity by Conair Mighty Mini Blow Dryer is awesome! It's so small and lightweight I forget I'm holding a blow dryer!<br />Don't be fooled by the small appearence, you'll definitely get much bang for your buck with this one! I have long curly tresses and it drys my hair lickidy split.<br />Would Absolutely recommend to a friend (and to a complete stranger too)!|pos
A great replacement for a dryer I had for years. It is, in fact, better than the one I had. A pleasure to use.|pos
I like this hair dryer.  MUCH lighter than my old one and dries hair great.  I like that the concentrator is included.  The intake screen in the back is removable, so I can clear out the dust that collects.|pos
I absolutely LOVE this blowdryer. It makes my hair so shiny and nice. It also blowdries it in less than 10 minutes (and I have pretty long hair) I have already had 3 friends test this out and buy it.|pos
In my small bathroom, space on the vanity counter is at a premium, this wall mounted unit works works well to take care of the problem.<br /><br />It was easy to mount.  I mounted near the wall electrical plug and had to tie up the excess electrical cord (from the unit to the plug),<br /><br />The unit has two heat settings and two speed settings.|pos
Very powerful, need a red dryer for the wife. This one is very light so it's not very tiring for the wrist.|pos
Excellent in every way! Was originally concerned about replacing a professional hair dryer with this one and couldn't be happier.|pos
Love this hair dryer!  Perfect price & works great.  I would recommend this to anyone with no hesitation.  I use both attachments, and both work great.|pos
I bought this because I loved the idea of having a retractable cord. The cord works as well as I had hoped, and the unit has an added blessing as well: The housing doesn't seem to get very hot, so I don't have to wait for it to cool before putting it away.|pos
I LOVE this hair dryer.  I have medium-long but thick hair, and my hair dries in literally 1/3 to 1/2 the time of my old hair dryer.  Comes with the two separate attachments (directional and diffuser) and then both work great and attach firmly but easily.  Great product!|pos
Works perfectly if you follow the directions for use. Folds nicely and doesn't take up a lot of space.Glad to have it with me on my European travels!|pos
It's powerful, not too loud, and not as heavy as people seem to say in other reviews.  Very efficient and does a great job.|pos
My hair is very thick and coarse and used to take forever to dry.  I inquired to my hairdresser about higher wattage dryers and you would think I asked her how to find the holy grail!  Well, wonder no more -- you can get a honking, high-wattage blow dryer right here on Amazon.  It's a little pricey, but isn't your time worth something?|pos
This dryer cut my drying time down from 15 minutes to under 3 minutes! I have medium length hair - Great price, Love it!|pos
I had to replace my 8 year old Turbo Power and didn't even consider purchasing a different brand. It dries and straightens my very curly hairy in no time with salon quality.|pos
It is in use every day.  There are currently few quality hair dryers in existence; this is definitely one of them.|pos
I use this to straighten my hair. I love that it is portable, and I can pretty much sit anywhere to dry my hair, which takes about an hour to do. It will overheat if you do not make sure the air vent is not blocked by anything. I have had this for years and use it weekly. I definitely will buy it again if I it ever breaks.|pos
Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.|pos
Came with great attachments! Love the long cord that doesn't get tangled I have long thick hair which usually takes forever to dry. But with this blow dryer takes me only 10 mins !|pos
Love this dryer, works so great and fast too. Bought it for my mom as a gift and she absolutely loves it! She has very thick hair and hair dryer worked great for her.|pos
I have searched high and low for the perfect hair dryer and I am so happy to say that I have finally found it. Having crazy curly hair I am no stranger to losing the battle against frizz when trying to straighten my hair. I was amazed at how fast I could blow dry my hair and I barely had to use any product to tame my lions mane. Not only that, but I barely had to use my straightener to finish the job! It's an amazing styling tool, and if I had to buy one again I wouldn't hesitate buying another Onei MK-II Air Ionique. And to boot it's a fabulous Christmas present!!|pos
I purchased this dryer less than 6 months ago and it's already stopped working.  I always plug my appliances into a surge protector and even so, this dryer's test/reset buttons just stopped deploying.  They won't stay pressed down and so the dryer won't turn on.  I'm staying away from Conair hair products, because of this.  Very disappointed in a product that won't last longer than this--especially considering how careful I was with it.|neg
Revlon RV474 1875W Frizz Control Hair Dryer<br />My grandma purchased this dryer for me about a year ago .<br /><br />I currently have a very expensive one given to me by my mom , but it was hers and it's very old . So I thought It would be great . WRONG . It doesn't blow hardly AT ALL even on the high .<br />The cool setting is great , but other than that it's horrible . And I have thick , kinky curls , so this dryer didn't help if I needed it dried quickly to straighten or dried just to wear my curls . It burned my hair and did NOT reduce frizz .<br />For my little sister , it's fine . She has thick straight hair , but it gets the job done ... in about two hours !|neg
I love the power of this blowdryer, it is the only one that works for me, I have tried others and there is a big difference, I am glad that I was able to find this one, they are not easy to find.  Thank you for having it!|pos
Perfect for use in our motor home, hooked on the wall next to the sink, don't have to dig for it under the sink.|pos
Happy happy happy.  Great air dryer (as per my wife).  This thing can blow some air.  Great product and feels good.|pos
This item is very great for its price. I would recommend others to buy it if they're looking for a hair dryer for less money. It also came in time, maybe in 5 days. Normally, 3-5 days delivery is great for me.|pos
This dryer works well with a round brush. I almost don't need to straighten it. It takes and extra few minutes but saves flat iron time.<br />It's not too heavy but it feels well put together.|pos
I am a 60-something female and as you can imagine have owned my share of hairdryers over the years but I have to tell you that this is the best and a real bargain at the price!  I am ordering more for gifts.  It is very lightweight and the fastest dryer I have ever owned. My only regret is that I did not find this one years ago.  You will not be disappointed with this one.|pos
Handy/powerful little blower that I keep around strictly for any guests that might be staying the night.  Perfect that it folds as it maybe gets used once a month.  No problem with the retractable cord yet but I could see that easily getting jammed at some point|pos
I am so impressed with this hair dryer it's straightened my hair and I don't have to do too much to it it has the speed and the heat that is needed to have a glossy shiny look for my hair I am a cancer patient and this is new hair so it makes it look very sexy and I really like the product.|pos
I wanted a blow-dryer with a lot of power, but without a lot of noise.  This styler delivers on both counts.  There are two heat settings - the warm setting is not much higher than room temperature, and the hot setting is very warm.  There are also two power settings - low is just enough to dry without tangling, and high is perfect for pulling hair straight on a round brush.  The styler is not overly loud, and more importantly, it is without that annoying whine you get with some blow-dryers.  I have no idea if the &#34;Ionic&#34; part of it has any merit, as I haven't noticed that it dries my hair any faster or with less damage.  I have lots and lots of fine-textured, moderately curly hair, and this styler does a great job.|pos
Perfect for vanity top storage! I hated the previous mess of a hair dryer cord all over my BR countertop. Only problem was, the distal opening of this hair dryer was bigger than my old hair dryer holder. So, I got creative and purchased a solid marble drinking cup at Bed, Bath, & Beyond. Problem solved! The solid marble cup is heavy enough to hold down the dryer, it fit perfectly into the interior of the cup, AND eliminated the counter-top clutter of a power cord.|pos
Broke after 6 months. One day it just stopped blowing hot air. Cold air works fine. It was great while it lasted.|neg
Looked for a long time for a hair dryer that has a low medium and high heat setting and a low medium and high blower button. This is a great hair dryer dried my hair fast!|pos
This dryer is not as powerful as most but that is a good thing. Leaves my hair soft and shiny, not dried out or frizzy.|pos
Excellent buy...this was for my sister and he is in love with it. The product arrived on time and in perfect conditions.|pos
This hair dryer really packs a punch.  I had used this exact model at a hotel in Dallas and then again in Pensacola and I had to buy it.  I've had it for a few months and it does its job and doesn't get too hot.  It blows a LOT of air and dries in a very efficient time.  I have long, thick, wavy hair and it usually takes me about 15 minutes to dry.  With this dryer I'm down to 8 and mid way through I switch to warm.<br /><br />Excellent dryer for this price!|pos
Great dryer and a great price.  Quiet and gets the job done. I had a Conair that was 6 years old that I used every day and it finally bit the dust. With that kind of reputation it was easy to know what brand to pick.|pos
Was looking for something exactly like this! I have thick, medium length hair and this is perfect to completely dry damp, towel-dried hair. creates less frizz than a standard hair blow dryer and I believe it is faster to dry your hair with this. I originally bought two different Japanese model hair dryers and returned the lower wattage one to keep this one! Just the right strength. It does get hot so keep a continuous, slow pace as you move this throughout your hair and you'll be just fine. highly recommend!|pos
I have had it for about 2-3 months and its just perfect!!! I love the color love the way it works and I am so happy that it has the different heat and strength levels! It dries my hair so fast and it stays flat most of the times even when it's humid outside!|pos
This dryer gets very hot, very fast and makes drying my hair take less time. My hair felt softer as well. Great dryer.|pos
excellent product we got as a gift. She loves it. It was just what she wanted. It works really well.|pos
Absolutely Love it! It drys very well, its super hoot, so if you are not use to using heat protection products Id recommend you do, just to avoid burning your ends- ITs size is PERFECT for travel! it fit so well in a small spot, and is very durable! Id recommend!!|pos
This blow dry is awesome!!! It dries my hair so quickly! I have used blowdryers, but this one beats them by a long shot. I like that it is heavy duty and built to last. Looking forward to having this for a long time.|pos
Great size and powerful air.  The tools that come with it are very useful and for me don't have a problem staying on.|pos
This is a great, great blow dryer. It straightens my hair better than any other blow dryer I've owned. I love it.|pos
I love it. It is neat and out of the way yet always available. The green light is bright but it makes a great night light. It is quiet and has great power.|pos
This dryer is perfect for a first timer's dryer, it does not make your hair frizzy and the temperature i just right. It works well and the cord has just about the right length. Its light and easy to use in small hands and the additional fixtures are great for styling. You don't want a dryer that drys your hair completely some moisture must remain or it will be frizzy.|pos
Works great!  Our camper has a small bathroom. I needed a hairdryer that was always up and out of the way.  This one is perfect!|pos
I have owned quite a few Conair products but nevrr again. The cordless wonder has been a problem from the beginning and worked every once in a while. It is less than a year old. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I bought it because I had the same trouble with it. When I called for help I was told to mail back and then they would send me as new one. And in the mean time?The guy had no answer. Duh I have buy another dryer. I have learned a valuable lesson. Research products before you buy them. I wonder if the 20 something 5 star people are still happy with their dryers.|neg
you get what you pay for. It barely lasted outside the warranty period; spend the extra $; it's worth it it|neg
Echoing several other one star reviews, mine failed after less than a year of light use.  Quite disappointing because the features and function are otherwise great.|neg
This dryer was fantastic for the first 6 months. Stopped working after that! I didn't realize there was a warranty card at the back of the user information booklet so I never sent it in. They won't replace this $80.00 hair dryer now. Very disappointed!!!|neg
It is a very good dryer, my girlfriend loved it! Arrived safely in its box with all parts! I highly recommend it!|pos
Magic. Pure magic. Attachments are hard to get off, but I don't want them falling on my feet when I'm drying my hair either. Heat settings in addition to fan speed adjustment are awesome. Cute color and feels great in my hand. Dries my thick mane super quickly!|pos
I bought this dryer because I was taking a trip to Ireland, and needed a hair dryer that could switch voltage. Before we left the US, I changed the switch to be compatible with UK power, followed the instructions and kept it on the low setting (which is just as powerful as the high setting on US voltage), plugged it into the plug adapter (you need this to be able to plug any US appliances into wall outlets in most other countries), plugged that into the wall outlet, and it worked perfectly!  I was originally going to use this dryer only when travelling, but it works so well that I use it every day now!  LOVE it!|pos
Great hair dryer.  And the price was great too.  It's sturdy.  It is a little hard to get used to with the controls being on the inside of the handle, but once you do it's super.  I use it on my dog after his shampoo and he likes it too.  :).  Would recommend.|pos
I have had this hair dryer for a year now and I love how quickly it dries my hair.  It also gives my fine hair more volume.  When I travel and use a hotel hair dryer, I can really tell the difference and miss my hair dryer!  It has a 5 foot cord and several drying options.  My only minor negative is where the buttons are located, I sometimes hit them when I grab the hair dryer.|pos
This is a great dryer; the handle folds down for easy compact storage.  I also like how it is dual voltage, but I'm not sure if the 1875 will withstand the wattage overseas.|pos
I have had this dryer for 3+ years and it's still going strong. I love the &#34;satin&#34; feel of the dryer, the 3 settings (plus the &#34;cool jet&#34; button), and the diffuser and concentrator are perfect. This dryer has been through the ringer- from airports to duffle bags to being dropped, etc- and it still works like the day I bought it. Super easy to clean out the dust in the filter too, the back just screws off. Would buy again.|pos
OMG I love this dryer.  I have thick short hair and asked my stylist what dryer to get next.  I had a cheap drugstore one that had lasted years but was on its last legs.  I have really hesitated to spend a ton of money on a dryer but went ahead and bought this since my birthday was coming up.  I read the reviews before completing the transaction and thought the people who said it dries their hair faster must be crazy.  How would one dryer dry hair significantly faster than another?<br /><br />The answer is I don't know, but it does.  It absolutely does.  I am a convert!  I LOVE this dryer.  I love how small it is.  I packed it on a trip recently and didn't have to stress about how much room it took up in my suitcase.  It is so compact and powerful.  I just adore it.<br /><br />I'm not great at reviewing products I feel strongly about so the fact that I'm even writing this should tell you something.  This dryer really is different than other dryers out there and the higher price is worth every penny.  When you can shave time off of your morning routine every single day, imagine how much of your life you get back?  Now, is that worth extra money?  I am a wash and go girl with little to no interest in makeup, fashion, etc.  I am a mom of three and own a small quilting business.  But I wash my hair every day and have to dry it to tame it.  That process has gone from fast to lightening fast thanks to this Sedu.|pos
Terrible product.  Cheaply made, loud and doesn't have much power.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Save your money and buy the Onel MK-II..|neg
Giving it one star because I haven't even been able to use it...it blew both fuses on my universal adapter.|neg
This is my absolute favorite hair dryer ever. It dries my hair very fast since it's ceramic. I love the styling options and my hair gets a lot of volume.|pos
Easy wall mount.  Plenty of power with two settings.  Easy clean filter.  The cord is a little short so distance from out let to mirror is a consideration.  Overall, I would purchase again.|pos
i thought I was just buying a cheep retractable cord dryer....it works better than all of my salon quality dryers! So happy.|pos
I'm a hairdresser, so I can sometimes go through blowdryers easily. However, this one has lasted over a year! I've bought TwinTurbo dryers before, but this model is compact enough that I can transport it from work to home easily, but the quality is not sacrificed. I love the black matte plastic, too. It makes any scratches or dings practically invisible.|pos
It functions well as a hair dryer, exactly the same as one you would find in a hotel.   However, the cord used to be super elastic (and it's not like I'm trying to drag it across the bathroom from wall-to-wall). It's been almost 2 years since I purchased this and there is ZERO coil left in the cord. It's like an extension cord is now hanging from my wall. This shouldn't have happened so soon in my opinion.|neg
Purchased along with argan oil. I love how well it straightened my hair. My hair feels longer and sleeker. I'm sorry I did not purchase this sooner.|pos
I have been using the Blo & Go for nearly two years and love it.  I have been looking for a second one that also can suction to a wall or mirror - and am disappointed this is unavailable at this time.  It's been like that for awhile.  Please start selling these again or tell me where I can get one.  Thanks!|pos
I love this hair dryer it work really well. Heat is evenly distributed throughout the blower. easy to use. I never have issues using this dryer.|pos
I hotwired this to the wall in guest Bathroom. I am happy and they are too. It has two settings and looks nice on the wall just as a hotel set up. Thanks for a great hair dryer!|pos
Great hair dryer. Perfect power and the tools that it came with are great for styling your hair. The best part of this product is that the cord is retractable. Perfect for staying organized!|pos
I bought two of these and they work well.  One that I had for two years now has one broken switch, but is still useful.  I use these for heating and drying a wide variety of things.|pos
I searched all over town for a hair dryer like this one before checking Amazon.  I had one of those universal combs and none of dryers would fit it and it is so hard to find dryers with comb attachments that won't break in my thick hair.  This dryer not only fits the universal comb, but it comes with its own comb which works just as well.  It gets pretty hot, so it doesn't take that long to dry my hair.  I would definitely recommend this dryer.|pos
Hard to use. I have a $20 hair drier that works better. Don't get why it is so expensive. It  does not have a cool button|neg
I love this hair dryer. It dries very fast and accurately. I love the 3 heat settings and 3 drying levels. Great product!|pos
nice hot blow drye, lots of power. it is a little heavy so be prepared for that weight to start hitting you at the end of the day in your rotator cuff but i can breeze through any blowdry with ease. love it.|pos
Best blow dryer I've had yet! The diffusser stays attached securely and it's not that loud. I love that it has different controls for the temperature and speed.|pos
Another 5 star rating for this hair dryer!  I have really thick hair with some natural wave that usually takes a long time to dry.  This dryer gets it dry in about half the time of other dryers I've used, and dries it straighter.  I don't have to use the flat iron nearly as much to tame the poof.  Good buy!|pos
Wife's favorite color is purple, so this was a must have for her. The dryer works really good and looks good also.|pos
Great product.<br />Powerful and dry hear fast. A bit heavy though but once you get used to it, it is doing its job perfectly|pos
Easy to use and right at your fingertips Ilovesanta that's tuts tote wall and shuts off when returned to base.|pos
I had just used it once last night but I know it just what I want. Strongly recommend. It's better than what I had expected.|pos
My Ginga loves this hair dryer and won't use anything else she has long red hair that took a while to dry with other hairdryers. Not this one though, we just recently got into an argument over the amount of crap she packs and the hairdryer is one of them. Happy wife is a happy life though and I have to admit it does cut down on the amount of time it takes to get ready!!!|pos
An excellent product. Sets up in seconds, easy to sit under, temp control is perfect. I LOVE HOT TOOLS, THE BEST MADE BRAND!|pos
I bought this item for my wife and I ask her if she liked it and she simply said she loved it. I think the retracktable cord is a main reason and the ther is it doesn't make her hais as static as other blow dryers..|pos
We have 3 of these, one in each bathroom. They are great and hold up to moderate usage very good.|pos
This is the worst hair dryer I have ever owned!! I ordered it shortly before taking a trip to Europe, trusting that it would work, happy about the fact that it was small and compact. I wasn't able to use it at all because it was so HOT I couldn't use it; and secondly it was burning my hair!! It was a waste of money and I highly discourage anyone else who might be interested in this product.|neg
I've had pixie short hair that dried in 5 minutes for most of my adult life. But since I've decided to grow my hair out, it has taken forever to dry. I wanted a hair dryer that was fool-proof and unintimidating and this product definitely delivered. It has 4 settings: cold, high, low, off which are pretty self-explanatory. Seriously, any newbie can operate this. Now I wake up with perfectly set hair because I'm able to dry and semi-style it in the evening before I go to sleep, with a little argan or sweet almond oil on my scalp as a heat protectant.<br /><br />People have complained that the 'cool' setting is not cool enough, but I actually like that. I don't like using the hot settings too often for fear of ruining my hair, but cold air would be difficult to deal with in cold weather.|pos
So far-pretty good. I have been using this dryer for a couple of months now and it gets the job done. What more can be said? It was a good price and it dries my hair..|pos
I bought this a few months ago and decided to go ahead and just now review it after months of using it.  I love it.  I had one of these growing up and I didn't know they still made hair dryers like these.  It does take a tad bit longer to dry your hair, but if you are wanting to straighten your hair you know it takes time to get that look.  It fits well in my hand.  It's not too heavy.  I don't use the comb attachments.  A lot of people complain about the brush attachment, but I guess they never used one growing up and know the trick with the brush.  No it doesn't grab onto your hair like a regular brush does since it's so soft AND because the air is blowing your hair away from the brush itself.  I put my hand on the other side of my hair.  So I have the hairdryer with the brush attached on one side. the hair in the middle (of course) and I have my hand on the other side to keep the hair pressed into the bristles.|pos
After about 6 months the dryer smoked and the motor burned out. Now, this may just have been one bad unit out of thousands sold. And the company rapidly replaced it, which is good. Not so good is that they did not send me a return label, so I paid to ship it.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I would rate this a pretty good dryer. It is reasonably quiet, and it is rated at 1600 watts, so it does not participate in the Hair Dryer Arms Race at all stores, where it is impossible to find a lower-wattage dryer that will not blow fuses (surprising more people don't complain about that). I would not want to rate it down for burning out. But six months is not reasonable, and this is an appliance that works in the home in a bathroom, which means it should be beyond any danger.<br /><br />Use your discretion, and keep watch to see if more people report this problem. I suppose a report to the CPSC might be in order, just to get a data set.|neg
This machine is amazing! Works like a charm. I have long, thick hair (down my back). This thing dries my hair in 3 minutes -- I have timed it. It used to take me over 10 minutes to dry my hair with a standard dryer. Sturdy design, and the light pink buttons add a nice touch too.|pos
I have long curly hair and I was convinced this wouldn't work. I used to air dry my hair  by sitting in front of huge oscillating fan. Needless to say, only the bottom half of my hair dried in front of the fan, but the roots and everything else was a wet droopy mess. So I wanted to try this - especially now that winter is coming. I really don't want to leave my house with wet hair. It dries my whole head from root to tip, and my hair does not come out frizzy. Its like the heat locks my hair product  [Paul Mitchell's Hair Curling Lotion] in place. I can fit my entire head and all of my hair in the container. I love that it has a lid in the front to open and close, a timer and it even dries my hair on the lower settings. My only con is I need to find somewhere to store it because it's pretty huge. Right now, it's in the dining room. Other than that, it was worth every penny. Would buy it again.|pos
Excellent Hair Dryer--my wife, daughter and guests love them.  Very well made.  Seem to last forever.  I am installing two more so we have one in each bathroom.  The first one is about 10 years old and running strong.|pos
I love this hair dryer!!! It manages to dry your hair with high heat in a gentle way.  Whatever voodoo they are using, I approve whole heartedly.  I like it that my hair feels soft after I use it.  After I dry my hair, I use the cool setting on high and gently cool down my whole hair.  It feels so nice, it's making me want to wash my hair right now!|pos
Awesome. Retractable cord works great. Blowing power is great. Light and easy to store. Bought it for our new camper.|pos
So far so great.  It dries my hair in a jiffy. I like the looks of it too, and the accessories. It is a 1875 watt hairdryer.|pos
Loved this hair dryer when I first received it...now it makes all types of noise and smells....filter is clean so I have no idea what the problem is.  Dryer is totally sealed so can't even open it to see what the problem is....|neg
I used this every day.  Our master bathroom is small which is why I wanted a wall mount.  Works perfectly and installed in minutes.|pos
First tried this item at a hotel. I received compliments on my hair. It also has a nice long cord.  I got one for myself and gave one as a give.|pos
My wife found this model hair dryer at a motel and fell in love with it. I wrote the model number down and bought this one. It has a nice hang-up bracket, a built-in night light, moves a surprising amount of air and works great.|pos
I'll admit I bought this blow dryer only because of the color. I love anything and everything green.<br /><br />I really love the attachment on this hair dryer it works very well when I am drying my hair to get it somewhat strait before I flat iron it. It's pretty much the only reason I won a hair dryer. I gets nice and hot, but not to hot to were I feel like I'm about to burn myself.<br /><br />I really love how the handle turns and folds up. It fits in my bathroom drawer perfectly.<br /><br />I'd reccamend this to anyone who just needs a simple blow dryer for simple things. Also if you need to save on space because of the folding handle.|pos
I bought this for my wife because I became convinced she was going to go deaf eventually from her previous hairdryer, I found it deafening from down the hallway but she's running the thing for minutes a day right next to her ears :-)<br /><br />This one is remarkably quieter - still a noisy gadget, but what a difference.  Much lower decibels and a more pleasant, lower frequency sound as well.<br /><br />The jury seems to be out on whether ions do anything or not, but after a couple weeks' use she did remark that it worked faster and she thought her hair looked better too.|pos
My husband I travel a lot.  There are times we need a blow dryer.  The dryer is small and doesn't weigh much.  We keep it in our suitcase all the time.  Its perfect!|pos
Nice blower for personal use....it heats well. I have fine and long hair and it took me 25 min to dry all my hair which is a pretty good time consider that a professional dries my hair in 45 min|pos
Love love love this blow dryer twin turbo is the way to go... It's fast and it's easy and it gets the job done ..... I would recommend this to anyone|pos
Used this in a hotel while away and researched it. Found on Amazon at a great price and bought two.  Nice, lightweight hairdryer that gets the job done quickly.  Would highly recommend.|pos
It came very soon after ordering it.  It performs exactly as it was advertised.  It is very easy to use and the recoiling power  cord is very convenient.|pos
GREAT PRODUCT AND CAME AS DESCRIBED. ORDERED FEW MONTHS AGO AND STILL WORKING AWESOME. GREAT PRODUCT FOR GREAT PRICE. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT|pos
Maybe I should expect the shelf life of a hair dryer to be less than two years, because that is how long this dryer will work.  I purchased locally, and spent $35.99.  It was ok while it lasted, but certainly nothing special.  Even though the Amazon price is lower, I would still say pass.|neg
I bought this expensive T3 Micro Featherweight Luxe Hair Dryer 2.9 pound from TheDiscountCenter. I was guaranteed that it had a 2 year warranty and that they would replace it should anything go wrong with it. Upon arrival it had a broken diffuser. They replaced it. I continued to use the hairdryer and then it eventually stopped working while still under warranty. I contacted TheDiscountCenter to replace the hairdryer. They ignored several emails. I then filed a complaint with Amazon who has also been unhelpful. I am in the process of filing a complaint with headquarters and the Better Business Bureau. Please know that when I contacted T3 direct to see if they would honor the warranty, they said the serial number was a counterfeit. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH THEDISCOUNTCENTER, they are liars who are selling counterfeit products through Amazon. What is even worse is that Amazon was notified about this seller back in September and they continue to let them sell products through the website!|neg
This sleek hair dryer really packs a punch. It dries my thick hair SO much faster than my other hair dryer. The different speed and heat settings are so nice (2 speeds, 3 heat settings). It comes with two attachments, and I especially like the concentrator attachment to help dry strands of hair nicely without blowing the rest of my hair around like crazy. So far this hair dryer has proven to be a quality product - I really like it!|pos
This hair dryer dries my fine straight hair very quickly and is rather quiet for a hair dryer. It's a little on the heavy side, so if you have hair that takes a long time to dry, you might want to get a lighter dryer so your arm doesn't get tired.|pos
it is better than what i expect and gives me more than i want. this hair dryer has three shifts which are perfect for me. it also can swithch to the cold model. loves it. highly recommend|pos
Plugged it in, dried my hair.<br />Brilliant!<br /><br />Cord is a little short, if your socket is waaaay far away from where you normally sit or stand, but the dryer itself is good for what it does, not so hot that you feel like you are burning yourself, but effective in drying my thicker hair.<br /><br />I like it!|pos
How great can a hair dryer be?  Aren't they all the same?  Well, as is true with many things, all hair dryers are not created equal, and this was a GREAT find.  It seems a simple thing -- just turn it on and dry the hair -- but I've been frustrated many times with hair dryers that are too strong, blowing like a hurricane no matter what the setting, too weak, barely putting out a cough of air, or too cold, or too hot, or that just fry themselves after a few months of use.  And, specifically, I wanted a travel hair dryer, since my last supposed &#34;dual voltage&#34; hair dryer went up in smoke (literally!) when trying to use it on the other voltage setting.  So, this hair dryer has been a welcome treat.  Not only does it do as it claims, in being dual voltage, but you still got low and high settings, and the great &#34;cool shot&#34; at either voltage setting.  Air flow and heat are consistent and the low and high settings are really just that -- less heat and air, or more heat and air -- and are noticeable in difference.  Comes with two attachments, as shown, handle folds, plus the back opens up for cleaning!  I have never found such a great hair dryer at even far higher prices, let alone at the great price for this one!  If you're looking for a great hair dryer that also can travel the world with you, this one is the one!|pos
This is my favorite hairdryer ever.  It's amazing how powerful it is for such a small dryer.  Luckily, I stumbled upon this at a hotel I was staying at and couldnt believe how much I liked it.  As soon as I got home, I got online and ordered it.  I have had MANY dryers before this, but this is the best and the best price.  Highly recommend!|pos
I highly recommend this dryer if you have thick or coarse hair that needs to be smoothed or straightened. If you are the type of person who just flips the hair around and smooths with fingers, this might be too much dryer for you, but I have no experience with that kind of hair. This is my first professional hair dryer, and I couldn't be happier. I have medium coarse hair (mixed race, ringlets, coarse but not kinky. 3b maybe?) that is currently just below chin length. I'm super-skeptical about product claims, so I did a lot of research. I read an article about a comparison of several models that convinced me of the effectiveness of titanium, and I knew I wanted 2000 watts just cause I wanted as much power as possible. There aren't too many dryers with those 2 features, so after reading the positive reviews, I decided on this model. From the first time I used it, I was very pleased. My hair was definitely softer and smoother. I never believed a hairdryer could make your hair softer, but this one definitely did. I can also dry my hair much more quickly, but I think that is because with this hair dryer, I am actually able to dry my hair like the hairdresser does (in big sections, using the curve of my head to smooth it out.) Previously, I always had to dry my hair in 1-2inch sections wrapping around and pulling with a round brush, which takes FOREVER. If I dry my hair that way with this dryer, it still takes about as long, but I don't really get much better results so I don't bother. CONS: 1. I still have to use a flat iron to smooth my ends. For the life of me, I can't get smooth ends with a hair dryer. I was really hoping this dryer would solve that for me, but instead it has convinced me that it is my technique, not the dryer. 2. It really does get HOT. I have to use medium heat around the edges of my hairline, and that can still be a little intense. If you have a sensitive scalp, this might be too much dryer for you. 3. The nozzles seem kinda cheap. My last hair dryer had  nozzles that snapped on, which made it easier to rotate and change the angle. These nozzles just fit snugly over the barrel and often come off when I try to rotate them. I can't speak to some of the other complaints about this dryer like weight and noise. I wouldn't call this dryer light or quiet, but it doesn't seem particularly loud or heavy to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to give up the performance of this dryer for those features.<br /><br />Hope this review helps, and happy styling everyone!|pos
A great product but too much for a 66 yr old guy with thinning hair, therefore wife has happily confiscated for her full head of hair!|pos
Works perfectly!!! I really love this blow dryer and the price is just incredible! I would recommend the blow dryer!|pos
I have been very happy with this hair dryer. My daughters and I have all tested it, and we've had consistently good results. We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.<br /><br />The dryer does work faster than other dryers we've had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We've used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.<br /><br />I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It's been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I'd be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I'm not and I don't.) It's a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn't sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall. It's worked so well that I'm still using it, but it's a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.|pos
it is very powerful‼ i like it very much!!!!!  it save me a lot of time to dry hair! ho ho|pos
This mini dryer is perfect for travel.  I have used it several times and am impressed.  It also came with a zipper bag for travel, which was an unexpected surprise.  It has a lot of force and does a great job.|pos
We were staying in a hotel in DC. The hotel furnished an Andis dryer with retractable cord. I enjoyed using it so much so I ordered one as soon as we returned home. It came just a few days later. Im very happy with it.|pos
For me, I have tried so many different blow dryers for me baby fine and hard to manage hair. And these previously tried blow dryers blew my hair dry fast of course (I have thin hair), however, they dulled my hair and also damaged my hair as the drying velocity was much too strong and the heating was just too hot!<br />So I tried the Conair 1875 blow dryer and was AMAZED and BLOWN AWAY (no pun intended)! This dryer I have found to dry my hair quickly and gently. Also, my hair is shinier and much more manageable.<br /><br />If you have baby fine hair like I do, this is the blow dryer for you!|pos
Love not having to store a hair dryer and so far the Conair is operating GREAT!  It's also a great weight and wattage for drying your hair.|pos
I researched and read reviews.  This was one of the better ones I found.  After I received it I opened and used it.  The hot is really hot - but good when your hair is really wet.  Then you can set it on warm and its good.|pos
This blow dryer is the greatest hair tool I've purchased in a long time. I can do my daughters hair now with ease and less pulling out of our thick curly hair!|pos
I've been wanting one of these since 1976 when my last one flew off the top of my car while driving down the street and broke into a thousand pieces (I forgot I left it on top of my car), but I thought they were no longer making them.  Lo and behold, I was at a hair salon in New Orleans, and the hairdresser whipped out one of these babies.  I exclaimed how much I missed mine from the 70's, and she informed me &#34;honey, they're still makin these puppies.&#34;  So I am now reunited w/ my beloved yellowbird.|pos
my wife said that it works great out daughter loves it too. I also ordered some extra combs just in case.|pos
My husband and I have used Andis hair dryer for years.  When ours stopped working, I was worried that I couldn't find them again, so I went on line with Amazan and was pleased to find the same brand.  we love these dryer and glad to find them again.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Ruth O'Dell|pos
I looked at this little dryer for one criterion that was my exclusive priority - I wanted a small handheld dryer that would not scare my pet cockatiel bird when I dry him after his shower in the winter! Needless to say, its color, size, sound and portability mattered. I chose this and couldn't be happier. He loves it too. The heat of both settings is ideal, it worked well for my hair too. The fact that it is dual voltage was not as important to me, although we travel to Europe a lot, but I can use the dryers in the hotel itself. It does sound a little louder than I had thought after reading reviews that it was quiet. The other issue is that the slider switch is a little difficult to operate and tends to slide all the way from end to end. It is difficult to move to the off position in the center.|pos
Not too big, not too small.  My hair is short, and I use this for a few minutes and it's done.  Easy Peasy.|pos
Though has standard features, the best thing about this hair dryer is practically weightless, almost as light as a feather, love it!|pos
I got this compact hair dryer to replace the same model, which I'd had for a decade or two but the cord started to wear. I found my old one to be very reliable and with a surprisingly strong air flow for the compact size of the dryer. I'd taken it on several dozen trips and used it at home often as well. This new one seems to be of equally good quality and has all the features I'd liked on my old one. I was so glad Conair still makes it!|pos
Love this !!! Exactly what I was needing and wanting ! It's fast drying and the retractable cord is great and fold down handle is very nice for storage and travel|pos
Couldn't find the hair dryer with comb in the stores so I was quite pleased to find it on Amazon.  The Andis Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer lives up to my expectations. It's everything I hoped to find.  I especially like the high heat setting for drying more quickly yet the fan speed doesn't increase so that it doesn't make styling harder.  I would buy this hair dryer again.  .|pos
My customers  and my family love it so I love,  I will continue to promote it the best way I can .|pos
I put the Conair 134R hair dryer on my guests bathroom wall and my visiting company love the idea because they do not have to lug a hair dryer along when they visit me.  I also has a night light on it.|pos
The dryer works great. The only problem is the hose won't stay on, it falls off when using it on my clients.|neg
I have thick and course hair.  I think this dryer does a great job, especially for the price.  It is heavy as the other reviews state.  I was using a travel hair dryer prior to this, so the weight definitely took some getting used to.  It drys my hair about as quickly as any dryer can.  I would recommend this product.|pos
I love this.  Very quick and easy to mount on the wall.  Very convenient and no mess on the counter!  Always available when you want it.|pos
Love this! It's stronger than most blow dryers I've used in the past 3 years. The look is very professional and the color is a deep purple with soft pink. I should have purchased the hair wand that went with it. Matchy Matchy!|pos
This hair dryer is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />Great product in a compact size and a low price that doesn't reflect the product - it works as good as any large expensive hair dryer.<br /><br />Great for home use and packs in a suitcase for travel nicely.|pos
Have had this dryer for about a year. When I first received it I was concerned that it did not seem to blow as hard as the dryer I had been using but it actually seems to dry my hair faster.|pos
This is a great blow dryer! The air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast.|pos
This dryer is great I have had it for almost a year and haven't had any problems whatsoever.<br />Very impressive.|pos
You see these at the better motels but dont find them at the big box stores , my wife wanted this in her bathroom at home. Ordered this one , got it fast , just what we wrer looking for great vender|pos
My wife and I got this to replace the same hair dryer we had used for years.  The old one started making a noise that sounded like lint was getting into the fan blower chamber.  In an attempt to clean it, I broke it... I know, smooth move!!  Long story short is that we were amazed to find the exact same dryer on Amazon for $13, so we snagged it.  Great dryer for the price and my wife and are are happy that we have a new hairdryer that we know will last a long time (as long as I stay away from disassembling it).  FYI, the sound the old one was making was no big deal.  I just felt handy for an hour and I broke it.|pos
The best. doesn't burn ur ears dries effectivly if it ever stops working im coming back to u for anotherone.. I luvv it I luvv it|pos
love love love this hair dryer makes my hair blow out nicely without the frizz nice finishing touch. Thank you.|pos
I ordered this for my craft room to help glue dry.  I wanted something small so it was easy to store.  It is the perfect size and has two speeds which makes it great when working on crafts.  I do wish it had hook or something from which I could hang it.  it arrived on time in good packaging.  I would even consider buying another for when we travel because of it size and weight.|pos
Have had several before, wife like the convince of being hung on wall.  This is our third unit, wish it was more durable.|pos
This is an excellent little hairdryer!  It is hard to find a hairdryer that produces more than a weak stream of air, and this one certainly does!  It blows lots of air and dries your hair really quickly.  I've had mine for about a year, and it is still going strong.  I just bought my mother one for her birthday (she loves it), as well as a second one for myself for travel.|pos
We first used one in a hotel we stayed and my commented that exactly what we need for home. So I did a search and found them on Amazon and the rest is history.  We love it.<br /><br />Thanks,|pos
I was in a super big hurry and tried this out before reading the directions and without my bathroom mirror.  Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.   Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.  It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  Update: died and the customer service was impeccable! Thanks Remington!|pos
My old Conair finally burned out after about 20 yrs. I have been looking for something similar. Conair now wants over 40.00 for the one I had. Well im glad I found this Andis, its very similar and fantastic!  Its a tad bit smaller which makes it easier to handle, powerful as hell, same controls and a narrow barrel which concentrates the heat where I want it, not all over the place like these wide barrel models. Nice long cord too. I'm tempted to buy another just in case they ever discontinued it. I love this thing and for the price its a steal !|pos
I've dried my hair twice with it and it made my hairstyle work easier than with my old hairdryer that is losing it's power.  Happy with the temperatures and heat.|pos
this is the 3rd one i've owned. i now have 2 (keep one in the guest bathroom). love the settings, how well it dries my hair without frizziness and the variety of settings.|pos
have been looking for a dryer likke this ne for a while now and I finally found it. Great product to own|pos
This hair dryer is so good that I ordered another one just In case the one I bought 4 years ago dies!, I have not had to use the new one yet, just have it for back up. I can not be without this hair dryer for making my curly hair straight.Use it with ceramic hairbrush (can order together) for sleek straight, non frizzy hair.|pos
I was so tired of having my hair dryer stored in a drawer, with a cord that tangled up in everything.....then I found this little wonder and I'm a happy camper.  It is a little larger than those you find in hotel rooms, but it looks nice, has a nice feel in your hand and most importantly, dries your hair perfectly.  It has two speeds which are great for styling, and a cord that is NEVER in your way.  I really love this hair dryer.|pos
I love my Wall mount hair dryer. It's right there when I need it. I would highly recommend this to<br />all my friends!|pos
I like it so I can  fit it in a small draw in the bathroom, if it didn't fold I couldn't put it in draw.|pos
Don't buy!!! Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!! Very scary. I will be returning this product. And I repeat...Do not buy!!!|neg
Purchase this hair dryer to use for travel, it folds and is small but has lots of power. Works great|pos
The wife loves this.  She's in sales and is very particular about her hair. Neatness really counts in her business. The item is all it was stated to be. We'll packaged delivered on time. She can't stop talking about this item. She's telling all hers friends.|pos
This blow dryer lives up to its claims.  Dries hair fast tames frizzies and gives my fine and thin hair volume.  I like that it folds and it is very light weight.  I am a little worried as to the warranty because their website states only certain authorized dealers are covered.  Amazon is not one of them.  I trust that Amazon will stand behind this sale as they always do.|pos
I love it!!  It's  well built, strong stream and easy to manage -- it's the best one I've ever owned!|pos
It was such a pity to receive this and plug it in only to find that it didn't work. The lights came on and the unit got hot but the air didn't blow. I was looking forward to using this as the reviews from others was outstanding. Had to return it and didn't replace it.<br /><br />REVISED: December 1, 2015<br />This new review is LONG overdue.<br />NOT ALL HAIR DRYERS ARE CREATED EQUAL! I never knew there was such a difference a hair dryer could make on the styling of hair.  After I had returned the DOA hair dryer, Onei Beauty contacted me wanting me to be happy with my purchase and offered to replace the unit. Just the customer service was golden to me until I realized their product was equally as golden.<br /><br />After I received the replacement I immediately had to wash and style my hair. I can't believe how shiny and soft my hair felt. It's so easy to style my hair now. And it's quiet AND light.  If you're on the fence in purchasing this hair dryer, do not hesitate, buy it. I can't thank you enough, Onei, for making me so happy. Sorry it took so long to tell you how much you are appreciated.|pos
Really pleased with this blow dryer. Quiet and easy to use.  Looks great also love the color.  Love the retractable cord|pos
I love this blow dryer. It's very light.<br />I didn't really notice quicker drying times than my old CHI dryer which I loved.<br />I gave it to my daughter and I got this one for myself. Good product.|pos
Very good hair styler. I like that you can buy tools for it if you need them. It has just the right amount of power to easily dry hair|pos
Bought this as a gift and my wife absolutely loves it. She says its the best hair dryer she has ever had. And I cant complain about the price. I would recommend this to anyone.|pos
This is the most pretty dryer that I have seen in a long time.  We haven't used it yet,b ut it looks very nice and was a t a great price.|pos
I had one for a year or two, but I dropped it.  So, I ordered the same one.  Pretty much perfect.  Note that the retractable cord didn't work on the first one I got, but they replaced it right away.  I LOVE the retractable cord and folding style, and the ionic drying really works fast.  Really good dryer.|pos
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE.... MY HAIR LOOKS GREAT AND DRYS IN HALF THE TIME OF MY OLD DRYER WHICH WAS OVER 15 YEARS OLD. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I HAD BEEN MISSING BY NOT HAVING A TOURMALINE CERAMIC DRYER|pos
I used this same one in a hotel in Vegas and it was amazing my hair looked just like I had it done at the salon. So excited I bought two one for me one for my sister. Mine was borrowed by a friend never got back ordered another one this one was defective bad!!!  I literally used it the very first time fresh out of the box and I swear there were sparks coming out of the outlet. Unplugged scared thought it was the outlet plugged it in a different outlet sparks again OMG anyway I tossed it in the garbage wasn't worth me packaging and going to post office etc and I was on vacation and had to go buy a new one while on vacay. I loved it but the electrical problem was not good!|neg
I wanted a hair dryer that would work both in the US and when traveling abroad. This dryer functioned well in Europe and everyone borrowed it. It is small, comes with it's own zipper storage bag and is very light weight.|pos
It kicks out the heat doesn't take up space, neat, nicely sized, blows like an hurricane you' ll love it.  Needs an man to install there isn't anyway I could 50 year old women.|pos
This is a good styling tool to give a pre-teen who wants their own.  Just one button for low and high and it dries hair really good.  There is also the button in the back for a shot of cold air.|pos
Great product for the price. Cheap and real strong heat. I definitely highly recommend this product. It works tremendously well.|pos
This blow dryer is very powerful.  I thought it would be very nosy because I've never had a home hair dryer that wasn't; however, it was actually pretty quiet for a hair dryer.<br /><br />There are two speeds: medium and fast.  The medium is so powerful I thought it would be enough to dry my thick, long hair, but it doesn't run at its hottest on medium speed.  Turn it up to full blast though and it's as hot as any professional hair dryer my hair dresser uses.<br /><br />It comes with two attachments:  1)the nozzle that directs the air flow in a small space, which is great for styling by running the nozzle down a shaft of hair on a round brush.  This is what I use to make my hair straight.  2) the round diffuser for curly hair.  Scrunch your hair in front of it to diffuse the air flow and keep your locks curly.<br /><br />The on/off switch and the switch to change the temperature are convenient to use while drying.<br /><br />The coolest part is that it's red.|pos
Drying my hair has never required much time since I live in an arid climate, yet this dryer seems to dry my hair more quickly & to increase the volume.  Very pleased with this product.|pos
I just love my new hair dryer!  My husband got me this after I learned that I have some hearing lost.  (Been using the dryer everyday for more than a month.)  The sound from this dryer is very soft and soothing unlike all the other hair dryers I've owned.  What I love about this dryer is that I no longer have to go clear across to another part of our home to dry my hair in the morning when my family is still asleep.  I can simply close my bedroom door and people in the other bedrooms aren't disturbed by the sound of my dryer.  This is a huge plus for us.  This dryer dries fast and makes my hair looks voluminous.  This is an appliance that I use at least once every day, it's definitely worth every penny!|pos
My husband insisted I search for a new, QUIET hairdryer and I chose this one based on all of the reviews. In comparison to the last few hairdryers I have had it is incredibly quiet and it is also very powerful. I have very thick hair that usually takes around 20 minutes to get dry and this has done it in half the time. Highly recommend it!|pos
it came on time, I have not use it yet, but feel it will do what I need .  I wanted a comb attachment|pos
My old hair dryer is on its last leg so having this 'Remington Ac9096 Silk Ceramic Ionic AC Professional Hair Dryer' has been a dream. Not only does the price work but it is also packed with features that really make my old hair dryer seem like something out of the past.<br />The features:<br />-Has three setting for hair drying (just like my old dryer)<br />-Drys must faster then my old one<br />-Two cooling air speeds that can be used while drying<br />-Doesn't frizz up hair after using (my hold one would give me major frizz)<br />-Also not too heavy (My old dryer was very heavy & bulky to hold the whole time I dry my hair)<br /><br />Having used this for the last couple of weeks, I have to say how happy I am with it. Drys my hair really fast & I haven't had any issues.|pos
this works wonders with kinky hair, use it to straighten hair on kids after washing. great that you can adjust the heat|pos
Medium weight, not too heavy like other professional dryers<br />Easy controls<br />Dries hair fast!<br />No tangle or twist power cord|pos
We now have two of this identical model. The first one worked out well so we bought another for a second bathroom. I can't speak to whether it makes my hair any shinier, but it does a good job of drying my hair and that's all I ask for. It does have different settings -- high, low, warm, cool; my husband uses the lowest settings to blow-dry the dog. I have noticed that the exterior doesn't get as hot as my old dryer so I don't have to be careful where I set it when I'm done. I have no idea what to do with the finger/curly thingy attachment -- maybe I need curly hair to appreciate its use.|pos
Perfect size for home use!  We have one in our RV and bought one for our home. This is a Quality product!|pos
The hair dryer worked very well, until the cool shot button got stuck and now there is only cold air emitted. Next, the hair dryer kept tripping the circuit  and blowing the circuit. It's a shame since the dryer was quick. Don't buy this unless you want to replace your hair dryer in a couple of months.|neg
This hair dryer is exactly what I was looking for.  It looks great in our bathroom and I like the way the cord stays on the hook.  No more getting the cord caught in the drawer!  The night light is a soft green and just the right amount of light in the bathroom at night to see where you are going.|pos
My wife loves it. She has evev reconended to familes and friend. The item has meat all expectations. Thank you|pos
My faithful old hair dryer blew out its last breath and this one has taken its place. The heft is perfect and well balanced. With 3 heat settings (none of which are as hot as my old one)and 2 speeds, this dryer makes short work of drying my  medium length slightly wavy hair. In order to give it a fair trial, we used the diffuser and dried my granddaughter's waist length curly red hair. Also swiftly done, and the curls remained intact. I hope this dryer has as long a life as my old one because I REALLY like it!|pos
When it comes to hair dryers, I have to be the weirdest person ever. I absolutely HATE spending money on something that blows hot air. I will buy expensive shampoo and hair products, but I just can't spend the money on a dryer. With that being said, I love this hair dryer! I normally keep my hair wrapped in a towel and then blow dry after I've applied my make up. Today I decided to blow dry before applying my make up, and it took me 3 minutes and 28 seconds to go from soaking wet to dry. Obviously not everyone will have the same results. I have fine hair and it is rather long, it hangs about 2 inches past my bra strap in the back. If you have thicker hair, it will probably require a longer dry time. It really does cut down on my hair drying time. I went from around 15-20 minutes to 3 minutes and 28 seconds.<br /><br />As far as the construction of the actual dryer. Eh. It feels very cheap. I'm curious to see if it will last more than a few months.|pos
Nice lite and compact design, perfect for traveling in Europe on rail or rental car when you have to pack lite|pos
I have long fine hair. I very rarely use a hairdryer, but when camping, traveling etc there is a need. Having dual voltage is a plus. This one is simple, reliable, dries my hair nicely on low, and in short does what it should do. Really like the supplied cone for directed drying.|pos
These are on the wall on our bathrooms- they look great  were easy to install and use.  They really help to clean up the clutter.|pos
If it's possible to have a love affair with a hair dryer, this would be the one.  The dryer's best feature is how quiet it is compared to the many that I have owned over the past, well let's just say 4 decades.  The other advantages are the multiple heat/cool settings, length of the power cord and the cool shot button.  All controls are arranged conveniently so you don't mistakenly flip the wrong switch while using.  Dries my color treated fine shoulder length hair with little or no frizz and have actually cut back by at least half, the use of anti-frizz and shine boosting products so think of the $ savings there.  Only thing I would change are the lack of detail in the instruction manual, but thanks to this review section it's not really needed.  You won't be disappointed.|pos
I had another Andis product that failed after 11 months but it was no longer available.  Returned it to Andis and they replaced it with this model.  Nice features - extra long 9-10' rubber cord which will hold up better than the usual 6' vinyl cords.  I usually avoid these high velocity dryers because they typically have a loud, high-pitched whine that can damage hearing.  This one does not. Very low pitch, acceptable noise level. Nice product - two speeds, 3 heats plus a cool button.|pos
I am really disappointed that I can't return this now. Every time I wanted to use it I had to press the reset button, which was doable. But today, it wouldn't even turn on. I heard a faint buzz sound and smelled a toxic chemical smell as if something was burning though I saw no smoke. Waste of money.|neg
This is a really nice hair dryer.  Handle folds as advertised and cord retract works.  Fits nicely into a travel bag.  Price performance is excellent and recommend as a good value worth the investment.|pos
I needed to replace my dryer quickly as the dog chewed the plug off of the cord of the old one.  Based on reviews, I ordered the Onei dryer.  It is lightweight, quiet (!) and really can get hot so less drying time.  I am quite pleased with it.  And the seller even sent a follow up email to ensure my satisfaction with the product.  I call that excellent customer satisfaction!!|pos
Great price, great product. And I love the retractable cord!! Comes with the two attachments that work great! Buy this one!|pos
I chose this hair dryer simply because I saw in a news article that it was highly rated and I LOVE IT. Not sure why reviews are about the button placement and weight. I am like such a baby with heavy items and this is fine. As for the buttons, you get used to it after a couple of uses. Great product and it definitely dries faster and is pretty!|pos
This is a great dryer. It is the second I've put in our home. This one has just the right power and heat!!|pos
I have used a conair dryer before and liked it.  The last one a had lasted about 13 years, so I thought I would go with the conair<br />again, and I haven't been disappointed.|pos
I love this blow dryer!!! I have never really put much thought into the types of blow dryers I have used in the past. I thought severe breakage, damage and dry hair were the negatives that came with the territory. Boy, was I wrong!!! This blow dryer dries my hair REALLY fast and the results are great! My hair is much silkier and not dry at all! I can almost skip the flat iron, and I have really course/curly hair!!! I have used the dryer twice so far and my breakage has been reduced dramatically!!! This dryer is lightweight and I love the 2 concentrator nozzles that come with it! The cord is nice and long as well!!! Although it was expensive, I think I have found a winner!!! My old &#34;CHI&#34; can't touch this!!!|pos
I got exactly what I needed! The product was absolutely perfect and matched the exact description on the product information. Purchased it online and then saw it in the store for almost double the price as it was here - great buying experience.|pos
My 20 yr old dryer died :( and I replaced it with this one. It is wonderful. Works well and the heat settings are easy to change.|pos
I bought this to take with me when I travel as the one I had used before did not have the Ionic thing.  I had not even tried it out for myself when my grandson took it and uses it every day.  He raves about it, so I guess if a picky 18 year old likes it, then there is nothing more to be said!  The cord really does retract quickly, so watch out!|pos
This is my second Conair Ionic hairdryer. This was exactly what I wanted and was not disappointed. Love the retractable cord, the folding handle and the 120/220 option for traveling.|pos
Compact and powerful.<br />This hairdryer works great on 220 V in Europe- it has both &#34;low&#34; and &#34;high&#34; setting available.|pos
Very powerful and works great.  We have these in all bathrooms. I have bought these as gifts and people just love them.  Mounting is easy and just plug it in.|pos
Handy, dual voltage good for foreign travel, compact, nice overall design. This is a great product. I bought one first and it stopped working for some reason. Amazon replaced it right away. Excellent service!|pos
Bought 2 of these hair dryers. The first one lasted a year then the fan blades started to crack and then the blades would rub on the housing. Thinking it was because I dropped it and cracked the fan blades i bought another. This one lasted 3 months same thing. I will never buy conair again!|neg
I love it the product works great. it is not loud and it gets really hot. It was definitely worth the buy. Fast shipping too|pos
I originally purchased this model to take on a trip to Ireland since my luggage space was limited and the Infiniti was lightweight and compact. It quickly became my go-to hairdryer and I now use it everyday. I have short hair and find the lower setting is sufficient to dry my hair without over drying it. Because it is so lightweight I was initially concerned that it might not hold up to daily use but 2 1/2 years later, the hair dryer is still going strong. Because I travel frequently I ordered a second dryer to keep in my traveling bag.|pos
Dryer works great and it easy to use and the built in night light in really a nice addition.  I really like this item|pos
Came super quick (thanks amazon!) and was a good price!  This just was more convenient to me than going to my local Target and looking through their whole selection, the reviews on Amazon can be so helpful!<br /><br />Its fairly light weight, not too noisy, and seems to work just fine.  My previous model was very simliar, a Revalon.  I see no difference between the two.  I'm sure the 'soft touch' material will eventually peel off like my previous one did but that doesn't really concern me!|pos
Really Like This Dryer My Cousin Has The Same One But Hers iS Silver<br /><br />Now I Don't Have To Go To Her House, Just To Blow Dry My HAir Now LOL ;-)|pos
Just arrived, although its cheap, it is good value for money, lots of settings to choose from, dried my hair evenly, great buy.|pos
This hair dryer works great!  My hair is dry in half the time and it's much quieter than my old 2500 watt con air.|pos
This dryer was recommended by my hairstylists. It really does make drying time fast. You won't be disappointed with this blow dryer.|pos
Very good!! I bought it for my wife and she loves it!! I'v been buying them for a couple of years, great service!|pos
I didn't know there was a difference between cheap dryers and a professional dryer. I have medium length, not thick but not thin blonde hair. It drys quickly, the condition of my hair feels like my hairdresser dried my hair. I am pleasantly surprised by my findings. Love the dryer!|pos
Great hairdryer, lots of power, lightweight, retractable cord, the color is great and its the best dryer I've purchased.  I don't know why I have to add more words to my review.  A few words should be sufficient!!|pos
I have used this product for several years on trips outside the US - mostly in Europe and Israel. This is a very fine product with three important factors:<br /><br /> -- 1600 Watt. At this lower wattage, I have never had a problem with foreign electrical power in any room I have rented.<br /><br />_-- Dual Voltage. Since its a travel hair dryer - I would suggest you keep voltage at 220. I kept switching it every time I came back to US and apparently the switch broke. See Customer Service below.<br /><br /> -- Customer Service. After 2 years of use, they said no problem and replaced the hair dryer immediately.<br /><br />I wish every company was as consumer friendly as Andis and stood behind their products as they do.|pos
I bought this for travelling (and don't use it at home) and I love it.  It is very light weight and small when folded.  This is important to me as I have started travelling using only a 21 rolling bag for shorter trips and the 21 bag plus a carry-on for trips longer than a week.  When trying to save space and weight, every bit helps.<br /><br />I have used it for several trips and absolutely love it.  I use it on the low setting plus add a diffuser and it dries my hair as well as the large one I use when at home.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.|pos
My wife was looking for a high quality hair dryer for a long time. Finally, we found what she was looking for. Panasonic from Japan, product that trust :)|pos
We had an Oster wall dryer for 10 years and it finally died.  This new one fit our old Oster wall plate for easy installation.  Power cord can be fitted to correct length so you won't have any excess cord laying around.  Dryer is strong and not extremely noisy|pos
It's powerful hair dryer. And there're many buttoms to secure the user's safty. I like it.<br />While, it's a little noisy.|pos
Best hairdryer ever my only complaint is that mine cracked after a year. But it still works so I guess not a problem.|pos
I do not speak English, but I'll try, very good product, works well, has the necessary heat levels, I have not submitted any flaw, I recommend, is light, not heavy, my experience has been good with this product.|pos
I am very happy with this hairdryer. It is very powerful. I have a long hair and it usually takes me a lot of time to dry my hair, but with this hairdryer I'm done for 5 min. It is also very light and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this product.|pos
Good, dry fast, except for the size! It is too big to take it on travel~ it can't be folded.|pos
Good power. Light weight. Nice long cord. Only drawback is cool shot button is sensitive and in awkward place. Otherwise great dryer!!|pos
i am a woman of color and i have to say i am very, very impressed with this dryer.  rarely can i just buy a product like this one that actually works on my hair (especially when i have to do it myself and i have a very nice grade of hair).  it get really hot and actually drys the roots and straightens my hair.  i wish i could say that for the numerous curling irons i've bought.  the one &#34;con&#34; i have is that if you are not proficient in drying your own hair with this type of dryer you can get burned and you should take your jewelry off. i suggest you get some kind of attachment to put on the dryer to assist in drying your hair.|pos
Does not last.  I bought two and they both burned out in a few months time.  It was Waste of money!|neg
I've had many good hair dryers and this one might be the best. Lightweight, powerful and it makes my hair so smooth.|pos
I was unsure of what to get for my daughter as she has thick hair, this works great for my daughter's thick hair!|pos
This was a replacement to my old one which I had for a very long time. The old dryer was dropped too many times that the plastic cover around the power plug was exposed.  My husband didn't want me to continue to use it for fear of being electrocuted because of exposed wires.  Dryer was still working though.  The new one works just fine. I will be taking this with me when we go to U. K.|pos
This is the best hair dryer by far.  It dries my hair perfect without it burning my hair or getting too hot.  The vendor delivered the product in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  I couldn't ask for anything more.  I am definitely going to buy a second one for my mother as a Christmas present.|pos
The retractable cord feature was what I wanted in a new hair dryer. That feature only worked marginally well for about four weeks and thereafter stopped working at all. If you are looking for a retractable cord to save space, don't even consider this product. I have three operative dryers at home. This was to be for my motor home. Waste of money!|neg
I always wanted one of those hair dryers like in a hotel. Now I have my own, conveniently hung at the side of  my sink. Plenty of power for drying hair. Easy installation.|pos
My hair dryer just blew up. I have owned many hair dryers but not one has ever had an internal explosion. It was aimed at the back of my head at the time so I'm not sure if there were sparks but there are large parts rattling around inside now. Can't wait to open it and see the damage. I used it maybe twice a week and it was less than a year old. Never again with a Revlon dryer.|neg
i got this a while back and its still working just like new. i love it. i wish the cord was longer but its pretty great and still living strong.|pos
I am glad that I purchased this hair dryer. It is quieter than other hair dryers that I have used in the past.|pos
I thought it was a bunch of nonsense when I read this hair dryer did all these awesome things to your hair, but it actually reduces frizz. I'm not sure if all hair dryers do this or if it's just this hair dryer, but whenever I use it I notice my hair is a lot smoother and easier to brush through. I've had it for 2 years and no problems, definitely would buy again!|pos
Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace her old blow dryer. Should last her years to come.|pos
have been using now for 2 weeks. good quality, blows plenty  of hot air. the cord winds well into the dryer|pos
This item was exactly as described and the price was great.  I would definitely recommend it and purchase this item again.|pos
Not much to write about, its a hair dryer, and it works.<br />It has different heat settings and cool attachments.|pos
it has useful function to me. Good product at an affordable price,I do not regret buying it， like it, love it|pos
I love it because it's like a package, with a zipping bag. It's small and light and easy for me to carry around.|pos
This was my second of this hair dryer because I accidentally left my first one behind at a hotel. I love all of the features especially the cool button for that last blast to set my style. My hair is wavy/curly and I love the diffuser, my hair always looks good when I use this dryer.|pos
This is my second dryer. The first one broke in half.  I used duct tape to make it useable until I received the new one. The motor continued to work well.<br />I ordered the same model hoping I could use the same wall mounting.  But no, they had redesigned slightly and just enough that we had to remove the first mounting and replace it.  I like the convenience, but I would really like to see them redesign it with a few more features:  keep it compact, wall-mounted, but add a cool function and make it quieter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It is very loud, even though they advertise differently.  I would recommend it as is, but would love those additional features.|pos
Was concerned about purple color, but it is not bad, it is a darker purple that looks more regal than gouche. The blow dryer itself is powerful and effective. Good buy.|pos
Great hair dryer...I use it when on the road or at the gym.  I like the powerful yet quiet air blast it emits (when compared to a previously owned Conair that died)...this is definitely an improvement and I recommend this effective product.|pos
Works perfectly to dry my curls without frizz & in half the time of my old hairdryer...perfect size and weight for me.  Love the bright red color too.|pos
This is a great product for the price. It was very easy to put together too. I would order it again.|pos
I researched a lot of hair dryers before finally deciding on this one. My priorities for a dryer is to not be too loud, and to dry my hair fast. I have thick long hair, and it can take 10-15 mins to get my hair completely dried. My old Conair dryer was working ok, but it was very loud and was taking a lot time to dry. Aesthetically, this dryer is very cute. It is quite large, but I love the texture and the pink accents. Some people had said it was a bit heavy, it is heavier than my Conair, but not too much where I feel like I have trouble holding it. It comes with 2 attachments, a diffuser and a concentrated air nozzle. I use the concentrated air nozzle every day. It is easy to attach and easy to come off. The best thing about this dryer is that it is not very loud at all! And yes, it does dry my hair a LOT quicker. With the help of the concentrated nozzle and a round brush, I can get my hair dry within 5-10 minutes. This is a huge improvement. It comes in 3 settings with 3 levels of heat, as well as a cold air button. The back of the dryer is easy to twist off for you to clean. Overall, I am very pleased with this dryer. Remington also has a 4 year warranty, which is very comforting.|pos
very high quality product.  it arrived very quickly and was in excellent shape when received.  god-daughter really enjoyed getting it and uses it constantly.|pos
bought it, lasted a total of four months before it burned out and quit working.  had a sunbeam before that worked for 5 years.dont buy this maker.|neg
Installed this a few months ago.  Super convenient and looks good too.  I love the night light feature as much as the hair dryer itself.  Power is good with 2 watt settings.  Iconic dryer does dry hair faster.  It was a little hard to get to the tiny screws in the back to get to the faceplate to attach to the wall, but it is sturdy.  I love the design and function.  I want to put one of these in the guest bathroom too.|pos
This product is awesome!  Mount it in your bathroom on the wall and no hassle finding and using it.<br />We have now bought 4 of these (3 for our home and one as a gift to a house guest who loved it).<br />Highly recommend!|pos
Works great, and the cord winds up into the handle at the touch of a button, plus the handle folds down so it takes up less space when it's put away. Solves my pet peeve about hair dryers. I wouldn't use anything else, so I bought an extra one just in case they stop selling these (heaven forbid).|pos
This is a GREAT product!  Perfect size and very powerful and dual voltage!  I would recommend it highly, it would make a great travel gift.|pos
I recently purchased this hairdryer after my previous one started to sound like a dying cat and was extremely hot to touch after use.  After a week and a half I love this new one!!!  I greatly enjoy that I can dry my hair on cool and high, with the temperature choices of cool, med and hot, as well as low and high speed settings, and cool shot to set.  It's light weight and efficient - I'd buy it again easily.|pos
I LOVE THIS BLOW DRYER..IT STRAIGHTENS AND SOFTENS YOUR HAIR INSTANTLY LEAVING IT WITH NO DAMAGE...I USE IT EVERY DAY!|pos
I'm a hairdresser I have try different brands this the best so far. The price is right n the brand is good.|pos
Got it. Exactly as advertised, Prompt Services. RECOMMENDED.<br />Perfect for everybody in the family. Just a handy gadget!!!<br /><br /> Thank you very much.|pos
My daughters aren't strong enough to hold my hair dryer with one hand. This is cute, lightweight, feels like a toy but is a real hair dryer that will dry your hair. Wonderful!|pos
After returning to Amazon a dryer that claimed to have a low noise level but did not, this one delivered on its promise.  Also, the diffuser is easier than some to use because you don't have to line up anything to put it on or remove it--it's a simple push on and pull off.  Have just started using this, so can't speak to its durability.|pos
Even though heavier than my other travel dryer, this one worked well on my last trip. I like the ion technology, it does seem to eliminate a lot of the frizzies. I also like that it has THREE settings for blowing. Since my hair is fine, the lower setting is perfect for the round brush. The retractable cord made is easy to travel with.|pos
I hadn't owned this 10 days when it created an electrical issue......the fire department had to come ...I had an electrician come the next day to make sure it was not my electric outlet or circuits and he assured me it was not my electric outlet....he believes it is the dryer.....I would like to return but now am being told by amazon that my window to return has expired.....not impressed with amazon's service....I should add that this is my third one by jerdon....and I have never had any problems previously.....obviously a lemon....would like it replaced for free....with a new one....not a re-serviced one....some one should agree to do that....|neg
Very easy to install<br />Works great and the led light is great.<br />It looks very neat on the wall.<br />The different settings are perfect.|pos
This is the best hairdryer I have ever purchased and used. I feel like I am in a salon every time I blow dry my hair. It is definitely salon quality.|pos
I don't like a large, heavy hairdryer so I wanted a small one that I could also use for travel.  Works just fine.|pos
Totally worth the money, it dries my hair well and quickly.<br />I would definitely recommend it to a friend. I love it!|pos
I have long hair.  Used to take me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair.  This dryer has cut down the time to 20 minutes TOTAL.  It's a time saver.|pos
Not sure it's a professional grade dryer, but I have trouble working with the heavier ones so this is perfect for me.<br />Also, the price is right.|pos
I did give a good review after a couple weeks of use.  But forget it now.  Now I changed my review. That 4 year warranty a joke, especially when Onei company won't contact me back after weeks of waiting.  I bought my hair dryer from the MKT Distribution off Amazon.  Good follow-up from this company but I received a bad unit.  I bought my hair dryer August 2013 and it broke down 3 weeks ago.  While I was blow drying my hair all of a sudden the power went down to a 1/3 of what it was.  As if the life was sucked out of it.  It can't even dry my hair now.  It's like a humming useless object.  Nice to know I wasted 90.00.|neg
Love my blow dryer.  It dries my hair asap. Good dryer, recommend. works well in all levels, love the attachments.|pos
I had purchased one for my wife to replace another brand that had quit after two years. She loved it and it does a great job drying hair.<br /><br />I have added another one on my side of the bathroom so we don't have to share. You'll love the fact that it is so small hanging on the wall and out of the way. Ready to use at anytime without have to untangle cords or put it away. It becomes part of your bathroom accessories. Love it.|pos
Love this hairdryer!  I had no idea that there was such a big difference in hairdryers, but let me tell you, there is.  I had a Ceramic heated Conair hairdryer.  While visiting family, I had to borrow a hairdryer because I forgot to pack mine.  The way my hair looked when it was dry was amazing.  It looked so smooth and shiny.  Not the norm when using my Conair.  I looked at the name brand and took note right away.  So glad I was able to purchase on Amazon.|pos
We purchased two dryers and love them. My wife was in a Chicago hotel where she them. After she got home we decided to order this dryer. This a great dryer for the price. We would recommend the Andis dryer to others!|pos
This hairdryer is amazing. It is fast, efficient, and doesn't dry outta hair. I'm very happy with this purchase and would recommend this product to a friend!|pos
We saw this in our hotel room and decided to purchase one for home and it worked out great for the guest bathroom.|pos
Blow drying my hair is by far my least favorite activity everyday so I like to get a powerful blow dryer that can help speed up the process... this one is great! I strongly suggest to anyone looking for one with power!|pos
I use this everyday and absolutely love it, nice color, light weight and love the retraction cord, awesome blow dryer|pos
I love this hair dryer. It has amazing power, yet is drying my hair very gently. My hair feels smooth after drying it which is a huge improvement compared to my previous hair dryer.|pos
a great budget hairdryer and its also pink. that in itself is enough to love. glad I got this product and it shipped fast.|pos
This is the hair dryer I have been looking for.  I have had an ionic dryer many years ago and had trouble finding one that actually works as they are supposed to.  I tried this one that my daughter had,  and bought the same one.  I have very short, straight, thinning hair. This dryer does not frizz my already fragile hair.  It works beautifully to dry my hair without the frizz and dryness of most other brands that I have tried (even ones that say they are &#34;ionic&#34;.<br />  My only complaint is that the concentrator does not swivel, causing me to twist my hand while holding it, instead of moving the concentrator into a different position.<br />  Other than that, I would certainly buy this hair dryer again.  Bonus - A GREAT price for a GREAT dryer.  Much less expensive than others and does just what I wanted it to do!|pos
anyone else have trouble attaching the nozzles for this dryer. Neither one of them screwed in place. I am returning it and ordering another in the hopes that this is just a defect specific to this dryer.<br /><br />*** The replacement arrived and still had trouble screwing in the nozzles. So I asked my daughter-in-law if she could do it. She promptly snapped them into place. After which she made some vague references to dementia that I couldn't quite follow .... 😉<br /><br />So I have amended my rating because it really is a quiet yet fast little dryer.|pos
Who knew there could be such a big difference in hair dryers?  Well it's true!  This hair dryer is SO powerful, it dries my hair much quicker than other models.  I love it.|pos
This little dryer fits the bill perfectly.  It is one great addition to our bath room.  Don,t know why we didn't get one sooner|pos
If anyone is hesitating about whether or not to purchase this hair dryer, you'll be sorry if you don't get it! My hair is naturally curly, but it's a frizzy curl so I often like to blow dry it straight. This dryer is by far the best dryer I have ever used on my hair. Not only does it dry fast, but my hair looks shiny too, and the best part is it holds all day! The only negative thing I can say about this dryer is that the function buttons are on the inside grip, so I'm constantly pushing the buttons when I'm holding the dryer, a bad design. Otherwise, I love this dryer!|pos
There are four thickmaned, long haired females in our household and this hair dryer has been fantastic in tackling drying and styling! It's also surprisingly quiet which is a bonus for early (5am) hair-prep. When our other hairdryer goes up in smoke, I'm going to get a additional Conair.|pos
I purchased this hairdryer by a recommendation from my hair stylist.  He suggested it would work perfectly for my naturally curly hair when I decide to blow it out straight.  This dryer works extremely well and helps cut down the drying time without frying my hair.  It's definitely worth the money.|pos
Beyond my expectations.  I have had Vidal Sasoon dryers  for many years.  They were reliable and very good. I will continue their products.|pos
I originally rated this a 4 star but am now changing it to a 1 star because this dryer broke quickly.  I would re-done the review sooner but didn't think of it.  Don't waste your money!!!!|neg
I have very curly hair, and the finger diffuser is perfect for dryer my hair without messing up my curls. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality hair dryer that works for all hair types.|pos
Bought this for my boyfriends dad for his birthday.  He loved it, the cord retracts great, and it works great.  Its not to big, and great to take with you on the go.  Plus it gets the job done!|pos
don't waist your time or money on this one.<br /><br />This POS is only used for an hour every other week.  My $10.00 Braun one lasted 7 years|neg
My mom had two of these hairdryers, Both of them have shot sparks out the end when I used them|neg
I purchased this hair dryer to replace a Chi dryer, one almost twice as expensive as this one, that was none-too impressive and had broken on me twice in a year.  I was somewhat skeptical of spending even $80 on a dryer as my last adventure had not been very successful.  However, this dryer does not disappoint!  It's reasonably light weight, powerful and easy to grip for self-done blow-outs.  I will say, it's not particularly quiet, but I am a consumer level user so I could really care less how much noise it makes.  All in all, it's a solid purchase, highly recommended!|pos
LOVE LOVE LOVE! It seriouskl y dried my hair half the time made it feel silky smooth its quiet compared to my drug store ones. Omg it's awesome. Buy it|pos
Exactly what I wanted, very small and very powerful. Perfect for travel. Amazon should make it easier to go back in and order another, no option for that on your confirmation site after you get the product.|pos
I got this blow dryer on Christmas of 2011. After a good year and two months of use it started making a shrill sound and started squeaking. I ignored it thinking maybe something was what could I do about it? But then after that in the 3rd month of year two (15 months) I started sparking the coils turned bright red and literally shot fire through it at my head. This brand is supposedly a good brand but I disagree. A blow-dryer should last longer than 15 months. Especially one that was used maybe a total of one week a month. I would steer clear here if you don't want to light your hair on fire|neg
I went thru chemo and my new hair is frizzy so I needed a special dryer and the Onei MK is it. It worked beautifully in calming the frizzes and finally being able to style my hair.|pos
This ceramic, ionic blow dryer is great.  It has awesome power and dries my thick hair very quick. Its the only one its size that has a retractable cord. I love its size/ performance.|pos
It does the job well, but it is a little heavier than I'd like it to be.  I needed a full size dryer because I have long hair and it gets caught in the air intake of the lighter weight, smaller travel versions.  There are no exposed screws on which my hair can get caught, as there were on other dryers I've tried to use.  I've always used and liked Vidal Sassoon dryers, and this one is no exception.|pos
Love it!  Works fabulous, not too hot and does everything it says it will.  I'm no hair pro and only use it for my 4 year old daughter but it works great for us ... also love the small size for storage and the retractable cord ROCKS!|pos
this dryer is very compact, and has good power for a little dryer.  I purchased it for my travel bag and used it for the first time this weekend.  I was very impressed with how hot it got, how small it was, how well it worked, and how fast it cooled after using it.  I would highly recommend.|pos
I use this blow dryer daily, it works for me, that way I won't have to borrow my daughters on. a good price as well.|pos
I purchased this to replace a 14 year old Conair sufferering from heating element failure.  The old I got for its claim that it was quiet, to use near my sound sensitive husband and hoped that this would be the same.  It is and more!  It does not claim to be quiet but it is.  It is delightfully light to hold too.  The 6 setting options work well.  I am more than satisfied, I now hope for a long lasting relationship.|pos
The blow dryer works great, so far i have had no issues with it. The retractable cord is convenient. It al o is not as noisy as some other blow dryers.|pos
This is a great hairdryer for the money. It's light weight and has a cleanable filter which should extend the life of the dryer.|pos
I absolutely love this dryer! It was very easy to assemble and gets extra hot. I would definitely purchase from this company again in the future and would recommend anyone who is in search of a good quality hair dryer to give this one a try.|pos
I owned this dryer for a year when flames shot out of where the dryer connected to the electrical cord.  As a result, my nightgown and chest were burnt.  The burn I sustained took four weeks to heal and left a two inch scar on my chest.  Frankly, despite the severity of the incident, I was grateful that my face or hair were not involved in the incident.  As I thought the malfunction was due to wear and tear, I purchased another one.  After five months, the dryer gave off sparks from the same location.  I was not injured that time.  I contacted Revlon and encouraged them to recall or discontinue the model.  DO NOT purchase this product -- I consider it highly dangerous.|neg
Always wanted one of these and this one is great quality so far. My hair is so straight and tangle free. So much easier than using a comb and dryer with both hands.|pos
The Hair Dryer died on us after using it for a month. All style but no substance with this product. The slide switch almost came off and will not work. No air for my hair! The only thing that worked well on this dryer was the night light.<br />Not recommended unless you want to throw money away.|neg
I bought this dryer just because it was my favorite color. It turns out that it also is a wonderful dryer. I love it. Lots of power and quiet. /Quiet enough to use on my puppy who no longer is frightened of being dried after his bath.|pos
We receided this product  at the Garden Hotel  in perfect conditio ok it was ok I will recommend to may relatives and friends|pos
I really enjoy this hair dryer. I needed it to straighten my unruly beard. I don't just it everyday but its loud fast and efficient.|pos
I was looking for something nice but quiet. This isn't bad - doesn't have the high pitched sound some of them have - though it's still a hair dryer so quiet is relative. Both attachments are easy to use and overall very happy with this dryer, especially for the price.|pos
When I first opened this hair dryer, I was quite dismayed!  It was much smaller than I expected - so small in fact that I doubted that it would work at all.  Last night I washed my hair and decided to try out this &#34;mini toy&#34;.  I was truly amazed;  while it didn't dry my hair quite as quickly as my large tourmaline dryer, it worked nearly as quickly.  For travel, you can't go wrong with this dryer!|pos
The temperature and speed is just right.  It doesn't dry out my hair.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer|pos
The hairdryer was working well but suddenly started making a really loud noise after a few months use. The seller was really helpful and sent out a new one which is working well.|pos
This dryer is wonderful, the power you have is second to none .., a little heavy but worth it for the results it leaves. I am very happy.|pos
this one is good and gentle on the hair, however I have not used many so cant really compare.<br />This one is nice and cheaper on Amazon so go for it.|pos
I have been getting this dryer for 5 yrs each  time I get it I love it more.  I have now got my sisters using it.|pos
I have limited strength in my hands and therefore needed the smallest and lightest weight hair dryer I could find and this fit the bill!  The main brands seem to no longer carry one this small, so really had to hunt for this one.  The low speed seems more like a medium speed which I liked.|pos
I purchased this to replace my old Conair folding handle dryer. That one was a bit more compact, which I liked, but this one isn't bulky and works really well. I appreciate the ability to control both the temperature and speed of the air. I would definitely recommend it.|pos
ABSOLOUTLEY USELESS. WAS SENT DRYER FOR USE WITH AMERICAN ELECTRICITY SUPPLY!!! TO USE WOULD HAVE HAD TO BUY MASSIVE TRANSFORMER.SCRAPPED IT AND PUT IT DOWN TO EXPERIENCE|neg
Great dryer but the first one lasted a couple of months, the second died after about 5 blow drys! So listen to the other reviews, I didn't and now I have to buy another dryer. Update: Tried a third, it died after 3 or so blow drys. Clearly defective model, it can't handle it's own heat.|neg
I purchased this to use for travel. As in, only occasional use. I've had it for about a year but have only actually used it a handful of times. This weekend I brought it on a trip. I plugged it in, and after only a few seconds, the wind died. I let it rest for a few minutes and tried again. Once more, only a few pitiful seconds of tepid warm air before it died. What a pile of crap. Andis owes me damages for the emotional trauma of suffering through an entire weekend with bad hair. Don't waste your money.|neg
I am very happy with the dryer so far. It fits in the limited space I have in my salon. I love the way the controls work and I was very surprised how much heat it generates. I am very pleased that it works on a 110 plug as opposed to a 220. I do feel that this is one thing you need to add in the description of this item. I almost did not purchase it because I did not know this piece of information.|pos
Excellent item, already bought one. Not too big, good power, good handling, wonderfull on the wall. Very good item. Very recommanded.|pos
This is my third Yellow Bird.  I keep one as a spare just in case -- air flow and heat are superior to any product (including the Conair family) that I've ever used.  I've bought them for both daughters, who will also continue to use them as long as they are produced.|pos
This dryer dries hair fast with various heat options and speed.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I bought this dryer after I used a similar dryer in a Hampton Inn Hotel and loved it. I am surprised at the complaints about this dryer.  I have used it for a year with no problems and I still love the dryer.|pos
I came across this hair dryer at a Hyatt hotel and I was impressed with how quick it dryes my hair (I have lots of thick hair) leaving it looking shinny.|pos
This is the best blow dryer ever. Gets super hot I was using The Chi deep brilliance dryer for my Dominican blowouts which was good but this twin turbo cuts my blowouts to half the time and gets far more straighter with just the blow dryer. You've got my vote.|pos
Drys hair quick! A little bulky but worth it.  The other reviews were worth reading for this item. Thank you|pos
It was great when it worked, but it went completely dead without any warnings in less than 12 months.  So that speaks so much about its quality.|neg
This is a great hair dryer for the price, and was sent out and delivered to my house ultra fast.|pos
I really like this dryer.  This dryer really gets the job done, not only does it dry your hair but it straightens my natural locks|pos
Purchased this for our trip to Europe this year.  It worked like a charm and insured that I was not going to blow up another hair dryer on our annual international sojourn.|pos
I like this hair dryer, it comes with a defuser which I LOVE! Also it has a cooler setting which lets me style without the heat! The price is great and the dryer is top quality!|pos
The best l have ever used.  Can see and feel the difference in the way my hair styles after drying.  Not too heavy and the controls are placed conveniently to enhance changing the temp and air velocity.  Reasonably priced and with Amazon Prime-----no tax and free 2 day shipping....hard to go wrong.|pos
I had been looking for a professional style blow dryer. My hair was growing back thin after cancer. My old blow dryer didn't give volume to my hair as this dryer does. Wish I had it sooner.|pos
My old blow dryer was really bad, so I looked up to read a lot of reviews. This one had quite good reviews, and I'm quite satisfied with this purchase! :)|pos
good product, relatively light weight and dry faster. I love the metallic look purple. I found it's better to use warm temp i/o hot temp, my hair become less fuzz and more shine and smooth.|pos
I absolutely love this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that I blow out every other day and this hair dryer has been perfect for that. The one downside is that it only lasts about 2 years (I just ordered my FOURTH), but that's actually pretty awesome considering the price. And it's so small that I can take it with me whenever I have to travel for work, rather than risk whatever the hotel might have. I definitely recommend this dryer.|pos
Great hair dryer. Blows hard & dries my medium long, fairly thick hair dry in 3 minutes. Love it!!!! Would definitely recommend this for any type hair.|pos
I can set my hair and fall asleep while drying with this hair dryer, It's everything I was looking for and more. Perfect for get sets and tight curls.|pos
my wife remembers her teenage days when this was all the rave ...now she uses it after shampooing and is extremely happy ...she swears this was the best product for the job and at a great price ...if you want to get something for the missus...this is it, you can't go wrong|pos
i have thick hair and it always seems like I have to spend FOREVER drying my hair.  This blow dryer is small but powerful.  I love that it folds up to store easily.  My long hair dries in just a few minutes|pos
So fast and lightweight I love it even my hairdressing blow dryer was slower than this one .. I am glad it blew up ! Love love love this product|pos
So originally I had purchased a  Andis 75370 Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic 1875 Watt Hair Dryer last year. The dryer was um, well I didn't like it that much. Too make matters worse, the attachment began falling off with the slightest touch. That becomes very annoying since my hair is so thick.... Anyways, I received this dryer on Saturday which was the day it was supposed to arrive. I had missed the delivery, but I was so anxious to get it that I went to FedEx and picked it up. I ordered this along with the Denman Brushes Thermo Straightening Brush (D79) . So I am Black and I have 4b natural hair. I had been trying to straighten my hair for the longest. I also recently purchased a Babyliss Pro TT Tourmaline Titanium 1.5-inch Steam Styler off of overstock.com, which I like way better than the HSI The Styler Ceramic Tourmaline Ionic Flat Iron Hair Straightener, 1 inch I also purchased last year.<br /><br />So the whole point is, I really like this hair dryer so far. I wish I could have got the blue one but it cost almost $11 for shipping which made it not worth it. The color is very vibrant. O yea the main thing is, the dryer dries my hair very quickly. The cord moves with you and was a fairly good length. I would recommend this product.|pos
Liked it.  The cord is definitely shorter than normal. Liked it because I feel it dries well but not at the expense of my hearing.|pos
Don't buy this item. I bought it after my Vidal Sassoon stopped working and this is garbage! I've never reviewed anything until today because  this was SO BAD. The buttons popped off, the temperature goes from hot to cold to hot to cold every 30 seconds while on hot and sparks come out about every 45 seconds or so. I'm not lying. I have  to use this at my own risk because I don't have a replacement, but I'm on my way to trying to find something that might not cause my hair to catch fire. Save yourself the trouble and go buy something else.|neg
Excellent performance and quality--heavier than many other dryers, but with a solid feel and excellent fan performance.  I like it more than other dryers I have used.|pos
USED AT THE BEACH IN THE HOTEL, LOVED IT, AM GOING TO BUY ONE SOON. THANK YOU BARB. DONT HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY.|pos
My elchim hair dryer is a very powerful product that helps me style my hair with ease. It has many settings and temperatures. I highly recommend this item to laymen and professional stylists.|pos
During normal use, the point where the cord enters the protector on the plug developed a bad connection such that it would only work when the cord was in a certain position. We had the same hair dryer before purchasing this one, and the same issue occurred, and eventually it just stopped working all together.<br /><br />This time around though...while using it, the cord sparked/shorted and started on fire in the wall socket. The dryer works well when it's not trying to burn the house down and the cord functions properly (if that's something you're looking for). There is clearly a quality control issue with this product and I'd suggest you try something else.|neg
The old hair dryer that my wife and I used was old and started giving off a burnt electrical smell. While I was online ordering another product from Amazon, I decided to give the hair dryers a quick look. After looking at several, I chose this one because of its features and low price. I must say that we are quite pleased.|pos
Not only did I receive the WRONG product, but it was also used when it was supposed to be NEW. I have this exact product at home, so I know what it's supposed to look like. The product that I received did not have the twist handle, and it came with 2 of the same attachments. I bought from Lucky Sales. DO NOT buy from them.<br /><br />I reordered this item from another company and still didn't get what I wanted. It's the right blow dryer, but it came with only 1 attachment. Disappointed. Guess I'll just have to order from folica.com.|neg
This blow dryer is great for traveling.  The fold up handle allows for easy packing.  The cord retractor is great|pos
I ordered this from Amazon and got it really fast,<br />I used it today, and it made my hair nice and smooth.<br />It's seems nicer than I thought it would be for $20.00|pos
My old one had less watts and was much better than the new one. The old dried my hair in half the time it takes now.|neg
Excellent hair dryer!  Bought this T3 Featherweight Journey Travel Dryer at Amazon.com with  Zadro Next Generation Lighted Travel Mirror & 12 inch Brown Faux Crocodile Pattern 4 Extendable Trays Doctor Style Makeup Bag.  So looking forward to my next trip...  thanks Amazon!|pos
I like it so much, I bought two, for two separate bathroom. It is good for the price you pay.|pos
I like this hair dryer very much. It hangs on the wall so one does not have to get it out and plug it in. It also has a nice nightlight built in and that's handy in a dark bathroom.|pos
This hair dryer hangs in the wall in the bathroom so you have more room in your drawers. It works well, but needs to be replaced every few years after daily use. It is powerful enough for my family, but if you have thick or long hair with a lot of girls in your family this hair dryer might not be powerful enough for you.|pos
Used this at a Hyatt Resort in CA.  I immediately bought one through Amazon on the stop.  works great ad is compact.|pos
I love this nice looking hair dryer.  It's powerful, yet sized perfectly for home use.  I highly recommend this product.|pos
Great product, lives up to its name, it is compact, lightweight, plenty of power.  I would recommend it to anyone that travels with a hairdryer.|pos
my other ionic hair dryer just quite, so took a chance on this brand and not sorry what so ever!! fairly quiet and love the optional speeds and temp's that my other one didn't have.|pos
Was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it! I have thick curly hair and needs a hair dryer that can handle that in a jiffy ... found what I was looking for. Thanks!|pos
I bought this to replace the exact same model we had for the past 6 years. My wife had dropped our last one for the last time. It didn't stop working, but had so many cracks and was so loose, I was working she would electrocute herself sooner or later.<br /><br />Anyway, we/she liked it so much, we bought the same model.|pos
This hair dryer was listed with a &#34;cool shot&#34; which I specifically wanted.  When it arrived I noticed it did not have that feature.  I decided to keep it anyway and plugged it in.  It ran for about 30 seconds and stopped.  Never to run again.  I have another Andis product and it works fine.  I could have paid to ship this item back which seems wrong to me since it was not as advertised.|neg
I purchased this hair dryer for it's Ionic qualities.  I live in an extremely dry and often windy climate, and my hair tends to get fly-away very quickly.  After using this hair dryer only once, I noticed a great improvement in that my hair was no longer as fly away as before.  The dryer has great features, and does the job extremely well.|pos
nice.|pos
I had one of these hairdryers for several years and had to get another when the old one quit.  Easy to use.|pos
It works so nice and does not take up much space. We love it. The tow speed also is really nice|pos
I love my hair dryer.  I was only looking because my mom needs a new hair dryer.  I saw a few negative reviews about the quality.  So since mine is pretty old, I can't vouch for the current quality standards of this product.  I've been super lucky with mine.  It gets daily use if not more. I always wished it had additional heat settings but using the cool burst has worked well for be. My cord has never frayed as others reported, but many times the last few inches of cord don't retract. I keep it clear of lint and I think that is a huge saver on its useful life.  I hope everyone has the excellent experience I have had.  Everytime I look at a Revlon or Conair hair dryer, I cringe. I've never had one of those last more than a year. After 10 years, I would purchase this product again, but mine just doesn't want to die just yet!|pos
being a professional hairstylist i got so tired of expensive blowdryers that dont dry the hair any better than the cheap ones. THEN, i read the reviews for this dryer and again i thought, yeah right. SOOO, i bought it and i must say, this blow dryer rocks. it dries the hair in half the time and leaves it smooth and shiny!!! FINALLY, i found one that delivers on its promise|pos
Excellent product!!!  It heats up super fast and is lightweight for easy use.  This dryer would've cost me a fortune at a local beauty supply place.|pos
My $160 blow dryer burned out on vacation.  I really could not afford to spend that kind of money again, but I have curly hair so having a good blower to straighten out my hair is important.  This one was cheaper, but I had never heard of the brand before so I was hesitant, but after researching and reading the reviews, I figured I would go for it.  All I can say is I love it!  It's quiet, it's light, it has alot of heat settings, the buttons are positioned well, and it works better than my old blow dryer as far as straightening my hair.  My boyfriend who also uses it, even commented on how much he likes it, and he is one picky kind of guy.|pos
excellent the product<br />the goods came complete with all accessories in very good condition.<br />the dryer works great and is equal to the image that is published|pos
This hair dryer is powerful and does s great and quick job of drying my hair after a shower. The price was right and it was shipped quickly by Amazon.<br />It is an excellent value for the money.|pos
I bought this for my wife - in fact she didn't even know I got it for her until it arrived. The (now previous) unit she had was making me deaf - from halfway across the house!!  This is much, much quieter, and the frequencies it produces are not ear shattering. She hasn't complained, so maybe she was thinking the same or perhaps she just likes how it does her hair - she looks good to me!!.|pos
I bought 2 FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 w/ Nano Fuzeion.  One was a gift.  I used mine and it's great!  I have dry frizzy hair and it's the first dryer I've ever owned that made my hair straight, soft and shiny with little effort.  My daughter thought I used a straightener. I highly recommend it - it's well worth the cost!|pos
I wanted this style hair dryer which is very hard to find in stores. This one fit the bill perfectly. Have only used it twice but appears to work fine and was exactly what was advertised. So far I am very please and happy with this product.|pos
I'm in love with this dryer!! My hair usually takes 45 mins to dry and with my new dryer it takes me 30. It is very comfortable and with all the space inside the air gets through quickly having your hair dry pretty fast. I would totally recommend this to everyone. It's at a good price also.|pos
Great Hairdryer with Twin Fans. Does make a scary screeching sound if the power drops. The Hair Dryer is not red, it is pink. also it does NOT have Ionic drying which is a good thing in my case.|pos
I love this product because it does a great job at drying hair with multiple drying settings, but mainly it is great in that it is not bulky like most hair dryers. It folds in half, has a retractable cord, and is fairly light.|pos
This is second time i've bought this dryer, after first one servced me well.  It's powerful but not LOUD with that annoying whiney sound they usually make.  I love the recoil of cord.  Happy happy, for second time.  :)|pos
I took one hair drier from my country. but it doesn't work because of .different voltages.<br /><br />so I had to buy a new one, then  I select it,  I got it in two days. it is so fast!<br /><br />It is perfect@!|pos
I got this hairdryer for my daughter and after seeing the results had to get one for myself.  I have very curly hair that is always frizzy in summer so matter what products you use.  This is the only hairdryer that seems able to dry my hair (in hundred plus degree summer heat and humidity) and keep away the frizz.  Best investment every.|pos
We visit my brother in another state for several weeks at a time and we keep items there so we do not need to lug them back and forth when traveling there. We wanted to have a spare hair dryer there, as when our large family gets together there are often items in short supply. This hair dryer fit the bill. IT IS RATHER LARGE. But it does fold up and the cord does retract. Despite its size, it still fits the bin that we use to keep our stuff there. It is fairly powerful and does a very decent job of drying your hair. The only con I can find is that the back end where there is a mesh screen or dust collector, does NOT appear to be removable, so as dust bills up, it will be a bit awkward to clean.|pos
first the price is really good. I've used it frequently several months and it works well. a little loud but just as most dryers|pos
Kept looking at different ones and finally decided on this one. I have hair I blow straight everyday so I need something that will last and so far no complaints on this one. Good output and a nice weight.|pos
I had one like this for about 8 years. Even though it still works I figured I should retire it as an extra or back up. I searched everywhere and bought several new hair dryers but none compare to my old one. I googled the serial number of my old one and with awesome luck I found the exact same hair dryer that I loved for all those years. Thank you Amazon for the quick delivery and the great product.|pos
I like this dryer. Compared to its price, it's worthy and both simple and useful. The shape and its power are impressive.|pos
Excellent... A++.+.+.++++++.  It works perfect and is very hot to dry hair.  Excellent article, very low price and ussesfull. Thanks|pos
After buying cheap, but high watt  dryers for years, I am a convert. This has cut my drying time in half.|pos
While this is bigger than the very small dryer it replaced, it is a light weight at the other, drys hair in minutes, and overall is exactly what I wanted.  I read most of the reviews of this dryer and others before ordering.  I know Conair products are good and a good value.  I'm satisfied with this purchase in every way.|pos
After about two weeks of purchasing, air leaks from the handle, the switch, and the back of the dryer. I concerned there will be electricity leakage, who knows when.Today I want to return it, but it says the return is only allowed within 30 days. I was too busy to request the return when I first found the problem. The product is of poor quality and dangerous to use, plus the short time warranty. I will never buy it!!!|neg
This hair dryer fills the bill to a tee.  It is small, but yet it performs just as well as the former larger unit.|pos
She needed a new one, so I surprised her with this one. She absolutely loves it. Its the only thing she uses.|pos
My husband and I used this dryer at the Ritz-Carlton Naples!  We liked it so much that we ordered Four:  two for home and two for the gym!|pos
I have curly, coarse hair.  This hair dryer allows me to have straight hair and maintain the natural volume in my hair.  I ordered two, just so that I would never be without it!  Love this product!|pos
WORKS GREAT,DRYS HAIR FAST LIKE THE LONG CORD.SHOULD OF PURCHASED THIS DRYER A LONG TIME AGO ,HAD MANY OTHER HAIR DRYERS THIS ONE IS THE BEST FOR THE MONEY.|pos
This is the second one I have had.  The old one finally gave up after many years of use.  It is the right size for me and not too many features to confuse me but enough to do the job - and nicely.  I think I'll purchase another one to keep in my RV.|pos
This is my second one in 8 years and I think it is great. This new one is for a new home.|pos
This dries my hair very well, and doesn't cause any frizz. I have naturally thick, long, curly hair, so whenever I decide to straighten my hair, I need to ensure that it dries halfway straightened (I use a flat-iron after I am done drying). The concentrator does an amazing job straightening my curls while leaving my hair without frizz and fly-away hair (I also use One N' Only argan oil to help control frizz). I use the diffuser whenever I want to dry my curls, and I love the way my hair turns out after a few minutes of drying.<br /><br />This purchase was definitely worth it!|pos
Took it to Europe, plugged it into 220V, and it started smoking immediately.<br /><br />it never worked. It obviously is not dual voltage.|neg
It does exactly what its supposed to. Perfectly dries your hair in no time!<br />Fast and furious ,no frizz love it|pos
My wife likes it very much. It's better than the last one she has that got too hot.<br />Thanks,<br />Jim|pos
This is the only dryer I use. I love the force and power it has. If you want volume this is the way to go|pos
wow. she is awesome woman say that it doesn't take long to dry there hair. I need to order one more for my daughter.|pos
This is a great product! The instructions are very clear and it was super easy to put up! Def. recommend!|pos
This has hardly any power.. there is another product Pro Beauty Tools Pbdr5886 Professional Travel Hair Dryer, White and Black  which is far cheaper at $25 and 1800 watts, ionic and dual voltage. I dont know why people complain about size of T3. Honestly you can get a smaller lighter dryer which are even more rubbish but light?!, you cant expect power from a smaller motor. I was actually looking for a full size hair dryer which is dual voltage. I dont care about weight so much as performance. Cant seem to find one :( But this is waste of money. By the way to note there is only ONE button for heat and fan. So only TWO settings, the description is misleading. You have low fan and high fan. That's it. There is no adjustment for heat level despite what the description says.|neg
I bought this to replace another Remington that I'd used for a few years.  So far, I've been really happy with my purchase.  I chose this because of the quality of Remingtons I've had in the past, and this one seems to be just the same as the others.  Quality.  The blow dryer does have a slight rubbery feel.  I've never had one like that.  Can't say I care; it's just different.  Not better or worse.<br /><br />I did choose this one specifically because of the attached diffuser.  Essential for those of us with curly hair, and it works well.|pos
The perfect dryer for travelers.  I owned a earlier version of this compact dryer from the mid 90s until 2013.  Used it everyday.  Extremely powerful for its size.  Would still be running if I hadn't plugged it into 220 volt outlet in Europe before flipping the switch from 110 to 220 volts.|pos
Small hair dryer, perfect to put on you travel bag and use anywhere. Works perfectly. I recommend this product to anyone|pos
I was happy with my new dryer but totally burnt after a month use. Lucikly we have not any injuries!!!|neg
bought it when my other one broke. love it! i recommend everyone to use this product regardless of the hair type you have.|pos
Used this dryer in hotel and liked it so much that I searched online and found it at great price on Amazon.  Dryer is compact, dries hair fast and heat setting is not too hot.  You have option of mounting on wall bracket or not.  I use as home dryer and also take with me for travel.  Great little dryer and prefer over many other name brand hair dryers I have purchased in the past.|pos
This is my second one. Had the first one for many years and now replacing it with new one. Was so glad they were still available as my family loves this blow dryer. It is so handy and ready to go when ever we need to use it! LOVE!!|pos
I dry my hair almost every day as my hair is rather long. This little beauty does its job, and does it well. There are plenty of settings and options to choose from, depending on what you want and what is best for your hair. I have no complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />Update: It's been several months now, and I still use this product almost every day, and it still works great. This is easily the best hairdryer I've ever purchased - strong, fast, and definitely good quality!|pos
I love that the cord is kept inside the hair dryer.  No more tangled cord. Glad I bought hair dryer.|pos
This blow dryer is light weight, easy to use and quiet.  I love it and it's a great buy for the money.|pos
My last one burnt out after 3 years of use. Hope this one will last longer. It works very well especially when 3 people use it daily.|pos
These are great.Our other got used so much , it finally quit. Reason 3 girls.enough said. so go buy one.|pos
Just what I was looking for! Had one almost identical but fried it in Iceland. Shopped all the locals and could not find this really small size. Bought one with a folding handle thinking that would make it workable but not so. Found this one on Amazon and it is the perfect replacement. Blows like a fool and is small enough to pack.|pos
I love Andis products. They all tend do a great job heating up quickly and drying and straightening your hair.<br />Also, their flat irons are great as well.|pos
I have had the blow drier for almost a year.  I love it.  I shut the bathroom door because the light is a little bright however it is great for those middle of the night potty breaks.  It works great for me and I use it every day. One thing that I dont like however it could be because I dont know what I am doing.  Every time I go to use it I have to click the switch on the mount.  it does not automaticallyclick on when I pull it off then push the on on. I have to always click the switch.|pos
I bought this item for my elderly mother.<br />She and others have tried to use it but<br />the hose keeps coming detached from the<br />bonnet.<br />I would not purchase this product again<br />or recommend it.|neg
this product does not work well ensendido the button came broken and I can not turn off<br /><br />este producto no trabaja bien el boton de ensendido vino roto y no lo puedo apagar|neg
This is the third wall mount I have purchased. L ove the convenience and that  I don't have to keep in a drawer.|pos
Bought this for wife and sisters-in-law to use when visiting.  They love it and the retractable cord keeps down the mess.  Comes with each to attach and remove diffuser and concentrator attachments.|pos
This hair dryer meets all my requirements.  It is compact, the cord stays out of the way the unit is reliable.|pos
This blow dryer works great for me. I am African American with natural course hair. It has the perfect amount of heat to my hair to straighten just enough so I don't have to use a straightener. But, when I do put heat to my hair after using this blow dryer it lays down so beautifully. I highly recommend this.|pos
This is small enough to take on the road and is also small enough to keep at home.  The power is very good.|pos
I bought this hair dryer because it was small and lightweight.  It also was touted as saying it worked on dual voltage for traveling.  I tried it in the U. S. to make sure it worked.  The first time I used it in the U.K. (after switching the voltage) it got very hot and stopped working.  So disappointing. I only rated it one star because the color was nice.|neg
This is the third unit I've purchased.  They last two or three years.  It is very convenient and has a nightlight.|pos
It's a good hair dryer, works great on all settings also a great price can't go wrong for the money.|pos
I just received my dryer 7-19-2013 luv it.. I have thick hair and needed a blow dryer that can do the job this dryer straigthens my hair something kinda serious.. I would recommend it..|pos
Love it love it love it.  The hair dryer with attachment works great and dries my hair fast.  Buying one for my sister|pos
This product is geat pushes air fast and hot. three speeds to suit everyones needs. Light weight. not too bulky. Best blow drier i have ever used. Dries hair fast|pos
My hairdresser recommended this dryer, I love it it drys fast and if I use a round brush, my hair comes out straight hardly have to use my flat Iron.|pos
THIS IS MY 2ND. ONE, MY FIRST ONE BROKE WHERE THE HAIR DRYER HOOKS INTO THE MOUNT, I WOULD MAKE THAT AREA STRONGER.|pos
I love this dryer. My old remington was amazing so i knew i wanted to stick w/ the same brand. Its amazing. Works great and the color is the best part. plus it feels like velvet!!|pos
This hair dryer is great. I have very thick hair and it dries my hair quickly. Very nice.  Good price too!|pos
I'm very happy with the hair dryer.  I like a wall mount hair dryer so it is constantly out and available out and yet off the bathroom vanity.  I've had this for a while and have no complaints.  I didn't buy it for the nightlight but it's still working after being plugged in for 24 hours a day for awhile.|pos
You can choose hot, warm, or cold air in high or low airflow. The long cord allows you to move freely.|pos
I like simple, lightweight and efficient and this was perfect.  Like the lighter heat option for finer hair like mine.|pos
This works very well.  Fits nicely in my hand.  Good for travel and / or  as your main hair dryer.|pos
Although Ferrari is a car's brand it's been known for some decades specially because of the design it's cars offer and now they applied it to the hairdrier.<br /><br />It's said to have a professional quality and it DOES. The item works amazingly well and looks very beautiful so as you'll when using it.<br /><br />The hook on its base makes it easy to keep the cable together after the use. The unit is very compact and travel is quite easy as well.|pos
It dries my hair with speed and leaves it with shine.  It is fairly compact and quieter than most dryers.|pos
Very lightweight, easy to use.  Exactly what I needed.  The attachments and travel case were an added plus.  Perfect for people who need power plus a lightweight design.|pos
It was delivered within a few days and I really like it.  It was really nice to be able to hang the cord and get it off my counter.|pos
My old hair dryer was a Conair 1875 that I purchased about 10 yrs ago and still works but started to make noises. So I figured it was time to look for a new hair dryer. I purchased this Conair 22NP Comfort Touch Tourmaline Ceramic 1875 and it is even better than my old one. It's light and comfortable to hold while styling and drying my hair. It dries my hair in 1/2 the time of my old one and my hair looks a lot better. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who is looking for a new hair dryer. It's a great product and you won't be disappointed.|pos
This is a great hair dryer - very professional results, several heat and speed settings.  Really worth the amount spent.  Thank you!|pos
Love it! Excellent product. Very good power as I expected since it is a professional product . I hope lasts forever as if used in a salon|pos
It is wonderful. I have spent a lot more on my other hair dryers and this one is great. It is small, lightweight, and dries my hair in less time. I will recommend it to others and would buy it again.|pos
Awesome product, pretty much as described. does exactly what it's supposed to do. If you want a good ceramic product, then this is it for you.|pos
Great this product. Love that I don't have to worry about cord. Quick free delivery through prime account. Would recommend to others.|pos
Love this powerful dryer.  It's pretty heavy duty, and it's a little heavier in weight than any other dryer I've had.  But it has the cool setting medium heat and High fast dry mode.  Pretty loud, but what hair dryer isn't it?  It smoothes the hair too , removing the frizz.  Combine with correct hairbrush and you will have salon results!|pos
Not only am I happy with this hairdryer, but I've already had a houseguest that is coveting it after using it. It has great power, is small enough to consider taking it when I travel, and was really reasonably priced. I hate to admit it, but it's better than the $150 Italian hairdryer that I was replacing.|pos
Small. cheap and works well for what it is. Don't expect the power from a full size dryer but this works great as a mini dryer for traveling.|pos
Love it, very powerful for something that small. Wish it could fold up, but still it is an awesome product.|pos
I really like this Conair hairdryer.  I've had it for several months and use it most every day.  It's easy to use, dries my hair quickly and I like that I can set the temperature and speed separately and that the cord retracts.|pos
Great blow dryer. It does the trick and dries your hair quickly. I like the little 'Cold Shot' button as well.|pos
Works great... Better than advertised! I would/have recomended this product to others and it works like a dream on my daughters hair too!|pos
I was very pleasantly surprised by this hair dryer! I am not willing to spend $50 or more on a fancy hair dryer, so I hoped this one would be close enough. It works great - better than expected! Dries fast and gets plenty hot. It comes with several attachments which fit securely and don't fall off. Also love the miles-long cord so I can stand anywhere in the bathroom while drying my hair!|pos
I bought this after my last Conair blow dryer pooped out.<br /><br />Pro: dries quickly, silky, smooth hair<br />Con: none yet|pos
We're in the health care industry, often times after our patients undergo MRI and other brain imaging procedures, they need to shampoo their hair. This product is just right! Works fast!|pos
I recently bought this Onei Mk-l Air Ionque Hair Dryer and it's the best ever!  It arrived so fast to my door and I use it on my shampooed  hair and it dries fast and my hair is not dried out like my other hair dryer..  My hair actualy feels like silk..very smooth...  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends!<br /><br />Thank you..<br />Linda<br />RI|pos
This was to be a replacement for a Sunbeam dryer we had in our home which is now working. Surprise!  We arenow  thinking of putting it in our vacation condo.  These dryers are absolutely excellent and we will buy another as a backup in case you all stop manufacturing them.  Highly recommend this product!|pos
I have used these little wall-hung hair dryers while on vacation and wondered if I would like one at home.  I DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I tossed my Remington and LOVE this little, convenient giant of a hair-dryer!  I think I am drying my hair in HALF the time I previously took.  WHY didn't I buy this sooner???  :)|pos
Nice size, convenient for travel, powerfull and light. Dual voltage is very beneficial if you travel to Europe. Very happy with the purchase.|pos
A great dryer for me (I have arthritis), not heavy and does all I need for  drying and styling my hair. Bargain priced too.|pos
I enjoy using this product.  Dries long hair very fast.  I have no problem recommending this product to a friend.|pos
We were concerned to begin with because of a post about weight but found that this was in fact the perfect size for us. It seems to be well built. Our issue with a different brand had been that the cord would break where the cord met the handle and it seems as though this one the cord is a little more protected. We will see how it holds up over time but as of right now I'm very hopeful.|pos
This is a great hair dryer. It is quiet and has a powerful fan blower.  It has 3 settings each for heat and blower speed.<br />There is also an instant cool button to cool down the air no matter what heat setting it is on.  It has a long cord which<br />is nice.  It is a litlle larger in size than some and somewhat heavier. However, the heat and blower features and quietness<br />more than offset this.|pos
My daughter in law recommended this blow dryer, so I purchased it.  It dries my hair in half the time than my other blow dryer.  It's light weight and easy to use, yet powerful!|pos
I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip. I'm not sure why, and I could have ended up with a faulty model, but it broke after being used three times. The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor, rendering it unusable.|neg
I love this.  It's just what I wanted when I decided to buy a blowdryer.  Fast shipping, too.  Good buy.|pos
Fabulous little blow dryer. Small, compact, great for packing and travel but still has plenty of power to get the job done quickly.  Worth the money, seems sturdy like it will go the distance!|pos
A bit on the heavy side but very well made.  Wide range of heat and blower settings.  Works great!  When was the last time that you bought an electrical appliance for under $30 that had a FOUR YEAR WARRANTY???|pos
I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.<br />So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven't given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.|neg
I had no problems with this, it works; the diffuser was what I really wanted (the concentrator I haven't tried) and that works too.|pos
This hair dryer sucks my hair into the back end and pulls hair right out of my head. I've had very long, very curly hair for 20 years and have used many hair dryers, and that has never happened before. I don't know how other dryers prevent this from happening, but they forgot to add that feature to this design. I've used it twice and am returning it.|neg
This dryer is easy to hold and has alot of power and force.  I have thick hair and it dries my hair very quickly.  A great buy!|pos
This is my second Blackbird.  I had the first one for 10 years before it gave out.  I have very thick hair and it takes about 20 minutes of drying to style and dry my hair.  I'm hoping I have this one as long as the first one.|pos
A stylist recommended this to me as it is the model they use.  It is lightweight, compared to what I had been using, is super powerful and does my hair faster.|pos
Love this dryer.have been using the same kind for several years. Lots of power for straight hair and low is also great for curly hair.|pos
I read reviews on this that said the night light was too bright.  I don't agree at all; besides, I would not recommend ever leaving a blow-dryer plugged in all the time.  It's a great little dryer.  No more having to keep in a drawer, taking it out, putting it back, every time I want to use it.  It was a snap to put together and get on the wall.|pos
I been using Conair hair dryers for years, but this one is the worst hair Dryer I ever used.  It burns your hair. I didn't have the box anymore, or I would have returned it.|pos
This blowdryer has great wind power and delivers a lot of heat - both make it great at styling my very curly hair.  It is a reasonable weight and fits comfortably in my small hands, which makes maneuvering it easy.  I only wish it came with a diffuser attachment.|pos
I love the size, power & settings! Also, the browdryer has a really nice look & is powerful too. I feel it gets hot enough on the hottest setting, medium heat on the medium setting & low heat on the low setting. I also like the cool air button too. I'm Black with relaxed African american hair and it works just fine for me.|pos
2000 watts makes a big difference in how quick n easy straightening your hair is. Perfect for coarser hair types.|pos
This dryer features a retractable cord. First time used, cord did not retract, and dryer was very heavy. Switch for heat control and on and off is supposed to slide up and down, but is hard to operate - does not move easily. and worst of all, didn't dry hair as well as the old conair I had.<br />Next!|neg
I have fine & thick hair and this product has cut down 50% of drying time.  It is a great product for anyone who has limited luxury time to spare.|pos
Just received The Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer and am very pleased with product. Dryer is quiet and hair dried much quicker than before.<br />Would highly recommend!!!!!|pos
I do not like this hair dryer at all. What a waste! I have fine hair and it's pretty long - to the middle of my back - and when I use this dryer, it tangles my hair with the fine little knots that hurt to get out and break my hair. It doesn't get hot enough for me, even on the high/hot setting and it does nothing for my bangs. Like other people have said, the buttons are right on the handle and get in the way when you're holding it, so that's annoying. It is heavier than my old dryer and I can't get used to that. So, basically, I have to go buy yet another hair dryer b/c I can't imagine being stuck with this one for the next 5 or so years. Sorry I even got this.|neg
This dryer is powerful but light weight and easy to handle.  The diffuser is large and the settings make styling easy.|pos
This blow dryer is compact, so it is very easy to travel with. It has a lot of power and dries my hair very fast. It is also very cute!|pos
We have a cabin in Tennessee that we use as our vacation home.  Half the time, we forget to take a hair dryer with us.  This has solved that problem.  The dryer has a long cord.  The cord hanger can be moved to either side when mounting but it probably isn't even needed.|pos
My wife was trying different brands of blow dryers for years. She was not impressed at all. Till our hair stylist receommended Elchim professional and my wife noticed the difference right away. She is very pleased.|pos
I purchased this hairdryer back in November of 2012. Fastforward to June of 2013 and someone was using the hairdryer while looking in the mirror and it BURST INTO FLAMES!  Luckily the person threw it down and put out the fire but last time I checked hairdryers don't normally do this.|neg
I've been using this hair dryer for quite some time and have never been happier.  Wall mount keeps counters clear and I love the small size and light weight.  Thanks very much v/r Susan|pos
I love it! Dries hair so fast! Very nice condition. Great I can remove filter and clean it! I think this will keep it working efficiently for longer!|pos
I like that this hair drier is quiet. It has multiple heat settiing with a good high heat setting.  It is comfortable fit for my hand and not heavy which makes blow drying less toil some. Although not heavy it does not lack in quality and durability.  I have owned several dryers and refused to setlle for a poor quality. This is superior in quality performance and durability compared to the typical Conair brands.I have owned for several months now and have no complaints and works as well as the day I purchased  If looking for quite and quality I would recommend Remington.  Well worth it.|pos
Sent all eight of them back, they were to bulky and big, looked smaller on line, not what I expected at all.|neg
I LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. If you have straight, no-volume hair, this hair dryer is PERFECT. It gives me the only volume my hair will ever see. I have two houses and have one of these in each. My first one lasted me 4 years before I took it to Europe and all of the added voltage was too much. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.|pos
Bought this to replace an old Sunbeam that burned out. Looks exactly like the Sunbeam one and even used same mounting plate already on the wall. Nice!!|pos
This is a very small dryer but with a BIG punch!  I was shocked how much power this little dynamo has... I can dry my hair faster than I ever could with my larger hand held dryer.  It is perfect for a small wall space and keeps my counter clutter free...Highly recomended!|pos
This is the second one of this model dryer- revlon travel 1875w I have purchased. I bought this one for my mother because she was dying for it since I got it and it worked so well. I bought mine in 2009 and it is still going strong! I have pretty thick long hair, about chest length, and this dryer is by far the best one I've ever had. I always bought Conair in the past but saw this on sale and decided to get it to travel with. It ended up replacing my full size dryer because it works better than my big Conair, dries my hair super fast (5 minutes or so) and is really light. I dry my hair almost everyday in the winter and only a couple times a week in the summer to give you an idea of how much I use it and it still works like a charm. Revlon for me from now on.<br /><br />Summary- best little hair dryer you will buy. Powerful, light, and great value!|pos
I had this hair dryer only a month and it has stop working. If I send it back I only get half of my money back on this worthless dryer.|neg
This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the 'high' airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds & then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.|neg
Low air on the first but the 2nd was great. It is in the guest bath so know one evr has to pack the monster blow dryer.|pos
I have only used the diffuser and low speed setting for this but I love that it sends only cool air so I get the right type of drying power. I have been using this every other day for a couple weeks and I haven't noticed any damage to my hair. It is also consistently the same temperature so I don't get a mix of warm / cold air. The cold blast button I think still works but I'll have to read the instructions again on whether you hold it down or just push the button. If it's that you just push the button, I don't notice it getting any cooler after depressing it. Other than the mysterious button, this has been great. It's easy to hold and doesn't slip in my hands at all. The cord doesn't wrap itself up while I'm using it, which was an issue with my last blowdryer. It was constantly coiling up when I lifted it. I do not wrap the cord around the body of my tools, so this was especially annoying. This is my first diffusing hairdryer, so I cannot compare it to anything else but I will say that when its last day comes, I am happy enough to buy the same product.|pos
E eReally worth the money paid I'm happy with the product a must buy my top list loved it wow|pos
Fully trust in the brand and the model powerful and good|pos
I first used this brand of dryer at  Barona Casino hotel. It worked so good I ordered one as soon as I arrived home. I thought it would be really expensive but it is not.|pos
Does it's job. Temperature settings are awesome. You won't regret buying it. I havent tried in any of the extra style dryer.|pos
I love sitting under the dryer and being able to read or do handwork and getting my hair dried hands free. I do wish it had 3 settings instead of just the two. It is either hot or cold and I would love to have medium as it does get quite hot but I love being able to do something with my hands rather than holding the dryer.|pos
I have had one since 1998 and loved the size and ease of use mounted on the wall, so when it started acting up and I needed to replace it... I was not sure if I would be able to find a replacement that I liked as much.  But this one was perfect!!!  I didn't even need to remove the old wall mounting hardware, it connected right to my old hardware!!  Very happy.|pos
The unit probably does tame friz but it leaves my hair totally flat. The cord gets stuck all the time and is too short even all the way out. The unit is heavy to use. Gave it away after two uses.|neg
worked great!!!!!!!!!!!!  better then my other ones and i had a lot of them ranging from 10- 100$$$ this one is the best so far!!|pos
So I was at a hotel over the weekend and they had one of these hair dryers.  I thought &#34;Wow!  This thing is quiet and powerful!  I need one.&#34;  Mind you, my old dryer was almost 6-7 years old so it was due time.  For the price I was skeptical but holy moly is this thing awesome!  I'm one of those &#34;I hate washing my hair b/c it takes forever to dry&#34; kind of gals and this bad boy had it completely dry in a few minutes.  It's heavier than my last one but who the heck cares because I don't lose hearing after use and I'm done in a few minutes vs 15 with the previous one.  So yeah... Clearly I recommend this. :)|pos
This is a great product for home as well as hotel! I have one in each of my 3 bathrooms!!|pos
I have frizzy and curly hair so it is hard to find a blow dryer than can straighten easily and quickly. This pro blow dryer definitely does the trick. It is strong and gets the job done.|pos
Good and powerful. I think it is enough for boys and guys to dry their hair within 2 or 3 minutes.|pos
Great price. It's a good brand, I did my research and its easy to control because of the different heatsettings .i recommend . Others brands are expensive when you could just get this product for less.|pos
The greatest thing this dryer has is the retractable cord - and, of course the varied choices for temperature and blowing power!|pos
Compact size. Powerful dryer. Light weight. Super cute hello kitty and pink. Dries my hair quickly. I highly recommend this product.|pos
I originally came onto Amazon to search for  a dryer that I had found in a store that was out of stock.  Once logging on, I decided to peruse the selection of hair dryers in the same price range.  This dryer had the largest number of reviews and the highest rating.  I was replacing an old dryer and was looking for something that would dry my hair quickly and leave it looking smooth.<br /><br />Other reviewers commented on how great the Onei dryer was, citing it's speed in drying, it's ionic component that left hair smooth, and several even mentioned how quiet the dryer was.  The dryer arrived faster than anticipated and I was in love the first time I used it!!  It did dry my hair quickly (the same or faster than other dryers), my hair doesn't require a pass through with a flat iron on most days as it usually did, and it's actually REALLY quiet (like, abnormally so).  While I don't have to worry about waking anyone up, it's quiet enough not to drown out the phone ringing or my music playing while I get ready.<br /><br />The attachments are great...as is the long cord.  I really love this product and hope it lasts as long as other reviewers said it did!|pos
I got this hairdryer because it was cheaper but still had great reviews. I would agree with some of the reviews in that there is not a very good medium heat, its either too hot or cool, but I still think it works great. I love it!|pos
This is a truly fast dryer. It met or exceed my expectations. I have had it for about 6 months and love it.|pos
Really love this hair dryer.  It is super lightweight and sleek.  Dries hair quickly and easily.  The price was on target and the shipping was ultra fast -- very pleased with the seller as well. Highly recommend product and seller! Kudos to both :)|pos
I bought one of these in 2001 for a 3 week trip to Europe.  It's still going strong.  So, I purchased this for a young friend, just graduating from high school and headed to Spain for some future studies. Hopefully, she will have as good luck with her's as I have had!|pos
This is the only hairdryer I've ever seen that has a cool blower setting as well as a cool shot button. I like the cool blower for finishing when the day is hot. I keep pressing the cool shot button accidentally, however, because it's so darn convenient. The cool shot button is exactly where my thumb naturally rests and I have to keep that in mind. The cord is shorter than I'd like, and a good bit shorter than my last dryer. The sliding controls aren't wonderful. The friction ridges are quite flat and the two slides mesh so well and are so narrow that my thumb can't tell them apart. I have to press those flat ridges so hard that it hurts my thumb, so I use my &#34;off&#34; hand to slide the controls. There's some kind of thin, plastic-like finish that's slowly peeling off, but that doesn't bother me at all.<br /><br />My last dryer was a Black & Decker. It was very small and compact and did the job for many years, possibly as much as 20 years. I do still wish I could have replaced it with the same thing.<br /><br />All this sounds like complaining, I know, but they're trivial complaints (except the cord length). I've never had a diffuser attachment before but I found it worth learning to use. I used to dry and style my short, curly hair in about a minute on the hot setting, but now the diffuser and the warm setting do it just as fast and better. The Conair hot setting is pretty hot, so if you need that you'll be happy. Best of all is that, even in the winter, my hair never gets flyaway with static electricity.<br /><br />I've had this Conair less than a year, so I can't comment on its durability.<br /><br />BTW, I bought this upon the recommendation of Consumer Reports. They called it a good value and I certainly agree.<br /><br />I've had it almost 4 years now and it's still trouble-free.|pos
Long and heavy duty cord, powerful, great attachments, enough settings and the buttons are a little recessed so you can't mistakenly hit them while you're drying.  Fees sturdy but not too heavy.  Good product for the buck.|pos
Never heard of this brand before, but found it in a boutique hotel and was very pleased with so I ordered it from Amazon.  Really reduces drying time which results in smoother hair.  Highly recommend.|pos
There aren't too many of the soft bonnet hairdryers available, so this is the one that I've had the most success with. I just wish it were easier to get replacement bonnets. I recently ordered 3 for the dryer that I already had, but the bonnets have been on &#34;back order&#34; for months, so I had to buy a whole new dryer.|pos
I love this hair dryer.  There are more settings on this dryer than I have ever had.  It seems to dry my hair quicker|pos
Its brand new, just as expected. Works perfectly! It fits all of the descriptions of when I purchased this product!|pos
Handy & convenient.  Love the cord hanger, I use it to hang my flat iron.  Very good product for the cost.|pos
This unit performs well and was easy to install.  We especially like the magnet &#34;latch&#34; which holds the dryer into the wall mount.  There are no plastic latch parts to break and you don't have to push the dryer into the mount to lock it into place.|pos
I bought this for traveling. I have very thick hair that takes a long time to dry. This blow dryer is light weight but still does a good job of drying my hair.|pos
I actually use this in the garage for drying glues, paints and finishes, replaced a unit I had for years, works great|pos
I bought thus dryer after using it at a hotel and decided I must have it.  I love the way the handle folds for easy packing into my suitcase, the cool button is easy to reach and my hair does not get frizzy!  Did I mention the retractable cord, another feature that I love!  I highly recommend this dryer!|pos
I purchased as a back up for the last one I bought.  I shuts of when it gets to hot.|pos
I have wavy hair that can be coaxed into curls or dried straight. This hairdryer works for both, and dries quickly whether for curly or for straight hair. The diffuser is wonderful. I can put my hair into it and my hair stays without blowing out of it. I get nice, voluminous curly hair. There is a wide range of  blower strength and heat available for this hairdryer, and for blowdrying straight, I need to use one notch below the maximum for both. Otherwise, my hair blows everywhere. Despite the blower strength, the hair dryer is pretty quiet and fairly light. The cord is nice and long. One last thing--I already knocked this hair dryer off my counter top, and it survived, seemingly without any problems.|pos
Love it!  Lighter th!an I thought a dryer could be.  Lives up to it's reputation...dries my  thick hair in record time|pos
I'm traveling to Europe and I need a hair dryer with diffuser. I really like it! is not heavy, easy to handle. Is hot but you can change it to a low temperature. Best part, voltage for US and Europe. Just love it! very cute!|pos
I bought this based on a recommendation from a freind. I think its a good haridryer, I have had no issues. My last one that just stopped working was considerably  more expensive than this one so just comparing the two this one comes out on top for sure. Lots of air flow and a large handle thats comfortable in the hand.|pos
Lightweight and compact but powerful.  Used one in a hotel and immediately ordered one when I returned home. After years of using a hair dryer, this is myall time favorite.  I use it most every morning and love it.  Plus, it was reasonably priced.|pos
This is not a compact travel hair dryer, but for home use it's sleek, lightweight, and powerful. It has all the features anyone would need, and it's easy to handle.|pos
This hair dryer is light and easy to use.  It met my expectations for drying medium length hair.  Very pleased.|pos
Product was shipped promptly, is exactly as advertised. Not too much, not too little.....does the job to dry both my hair and my Chihuahua's after a bath.|pos
I love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer. It works! Other than that, it's pretty much your average hair dryer. I do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located, but I expect I'll eventually adapt to that.|pos
My wife used this brand she saw at Disney while on vacation last year, she liked it enough that she decided she wanted one like it. After searching Amazon I was surprised to find it and order one. Works well and wife is happy. Seems to have a stronger air output than more expensive brands.|pos
I love this Vidal Sassoon dryer. Do not be fooled by its size and &#34;full size&#34;. It is super light and dries my long hair in minutes. It has 2 heat settings and a hot and warm mode for drying and setting respectively. It has the option to turn the ions on and off which helps in a good blow dry. It comes with the nozzle attachment for focussed drying and prevention of frizzies. It also comes with the curl enhancer which helps in creating voluminous natural waves.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how light it is and I manage to dry my hair with only one hand, while combing with the other hand.|pos
My dream hair dryer....great product.  This hair dryer dries my hair quickly and gives me the smoothness that I want.  I enjoy using this hair dryer because it gets the job done in less time.  My hair is thick and it takes forever to dry but not with the Andis 82005 Professional 1875 Watt Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer!!|pos
I bought this because I could not use my Conair Infiniti pro hot brush when I travel to other country. Fortunately, this performs much better than the conair hot brush. Aside from providing me a good styled-hair, my hair also shines better after using this. This product is very durable, it shows on the design. I've been using this regularly for three months now.|pos
We went out West traveling, I took this mini hair dryer. It worked great. It was small,but it worked better than my full size one at home. It didn't take up much room, and it was light. Would recommend this to anyone traveling . Perfect!|pos
my wife is very happy with this purchase. I chose the product because the ad stated it was quiet, light powerful, professional quality. I have found everyting to be as advertised or better. hairblower is VERY QUIET and light to hold. these were impotant factors in choosing this prduct. price was very reasonable. delivery was quick. product was received in pristine condition. I highly recommend this product and seller|pos
Makes my hair shiny and soft.  I love this flat iron!  Great deal compared to other quality flat irons!  I would highly recommend to anyone.|pos
A hotel we recently stayed in had this hair dryer and I loved it so much, had to buy one when I got home.<br />Dries hair quickly and is nice and light too.|pos
The first two did not work and were replaced by Amazon. The 3rd one worked for 14 months and then burned up - after turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Luckily, we were home and unplugged it before it caught fire!|neg
Like the fact it is so compact that it is not difficult for travel as it takes up little room. Has a nice quiet sound and drys my hair very nicely.  Also the retractable cord it great so you don't have alot of cord that you have to wind up. This item also works well in a small drawer if being used at home.|pos
I felt this dryer was great for the money. It is not one of the best dryers out there but I felt it was sufficient in getting my hair dry in a short time period. I am not one of those folks who wants to wait very long for my hair to dry but I also didn't want to use a towel either. That's why I love this dryer. It is low cost which should be great for those people on a tight budget.|pos
I ordered for this hair dryer because of the advantages i saw.I have had a revlon dryer i had used for a long time and i guess i was due for a change.<br />I really looked out for one very good and with very advanced settings.I was able to get this dryer down to Africa,from the U.S.However,on receiving Infiniti Conair dryer;i was so anxious to use it.Like my custom has always been, i read the manual and was so suprised it was a 125volts!I was so dissappointed...i have not been able to use the product since i received it.<br />My question is how do i use the product since my country has a voltage of 220volts.I would really love to.|pos
Brought this to Thailand. Although there were blow dryers in the rooms, i always prefer to have one that is powerful enough to dry my hair quickly. This is awesome! Compact and worked great. Just make sure you read directions before using in a 220 v outlet!|pos
My wife has M/S and she has difficulty holding the hair dryer. I was skeptical of this product working because it is one of those As seen on TV products. Boy, was I surprised. Out of the box, on the mirror, connected the hair dryer and hands free drying. We happened to have a full size mirror above the bathroom sink. Since the blo and go is a little heavy, I don't think it would work well on a small mirror of a medicine cabinet.|pos
My hair is super thick and in the past when I used to blow dry it never came out soft and smooth like after the salon, it was always dry and frizzy. A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn't afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I've never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It's never been smoother or softer.<br /><br />The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn't very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it's nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn't sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I've used the concentrator with great success and I haven't used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).<br /><br />For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations. I'm going to buy the other remington Tstudio styling tools just based on my experience with the dryer.|pos
Not a good buy... Nothing like the ion brand!! Doesn't get hot enough to dry thick hair!!! Only good for short thin hair maybe!!!|neg
I had a little difficulty finding a surface to put it on that would match up with a seat that I had to be high enough up into the hood.  If you're short like me (5'2&#34;), you can't just put in on the dining room table and use one of its chairs.  It would be helpful if the advertizing text stated how high the top of the inside of the hood was from the surface on which the dryer rested.|pos
I really love this hair dryer. My old dryer died and I needed to get a new one quickly. I wanted one that was quiet and dry well. I have an Onei flat iron that I'm very happy with so I was happy to buy the hair dryer. I love the low volume of the hair dryer, love the ionic switch, and it really does dry well. I am happy with my purchase.|pos
Wife loves it as does my Daughter. Bought another one for her.<br />Fast Drying With out the FRizzzzz..!! Light and easy to hold.<br />Great Price, Fast Ship. Great Product.|pos
I was so tired of cheap hair dryers breaking and decided to purchase this dryer. I am very pleased with this hair dryer. It is much quieter than most dryers and dries hair quickly. I would recommend!|pos
My daughter had gotten an ionic hair dryer and told me how much she enjoyed it. So, though my hair is much shorter than hers, I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the Onei MK_ll, a different brand than my daughters.  I loved it the first time  I used it.  I color my hair and it is on the thin side and this dryer tames the frizzies and adds body and shine.<br />My daughter tried it when she came to visit and, of course, loved it!! So--I bought her one, too.  She claims that it is light, easy to handle, dries her hair quicker and over all, does a much better job than her old one.<br />The delivery was prompt and product was in good condition.  No problems.|pos
I bought this dryer because it came with a diffuser and I needed a dual voltage dryer for travel to Europe. It folds down and is great for travel. It works well on both 110 and 220V. Reviews of other dryers said that they only worked on high when using 220V, but this has both low and high on both voltages. The diffuser does a decent job of diffusing the air and dried my hair well without firzzing it. I only plan to use it for travel and only used it for 2 weeks overseas, so I can't vouch for its durability. At this time, though, I am very satisfied with it.|pos
By far the best hair dryer I have owned. I have very frizzy curly hair and this dryer definitely does its job. I can tell a huge difference after using it the first time.|pos
I was little skepital for spending $70 for a hair dryer. I thought there are no difference between $30 dryer and $70 dryer. This hair dryer is very quite, light weight, dry quick and well made. I got it for two weeks now so far so good!|pos
This is my third Andis Hangup Pro Turbo Hair Dryer of this model over the past 15 years or so. My husband and I use it on a daily basis and love the convenience of having it on the wall for easy access. Product is very reliable. Must keep dust screen in back of handheld unit clean. It is very easy to clean as it unscrews. Wall mount has a reset button if unit shuts down due to overheating which doesn't usually occur if screen is kept clean. Would purchase another of this product when needed.|pos
I loved this travel dryer when I first used it.  However this morning, I plugged it in ready to go and there was no response.  I tried using several outlets in our house and got no action.  My last hair dryer lasted 8 years without failing.  This is very disappointing.|neg
Bought this hair dryer for my wife to replace her old one that was starting to physically wear out. This one dried her hair several minutes faster than the old one (even with hair/dust cleaned out of the filter). Highly recommend, the finish is a soft touch / satiny plastic paint / coating that feels good to hold in your hand.|pos
This is a a wonderful dryer, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Why didn't I buy it earlier?|pos
After much heavy use by two people daily, my original Remington Ac2015 finally bit the dust.  It lasted a good long time.  I loved it so much I ordered the same one as a replacement.  I didn't even see what else was out there, which I never do - I'm the research queen!  I figured why look for something else when this one has everything.  It's quiet, has perfect temperatures and it dries fast.  Leaves my hair silky and shiny. It is a bit heavier than some but you get used to it quickly.  Feels solid and has a nice no slip texture plus an extra long cord.  Highly recommended.|pos
The dryer is quiet and powerful. There are three heat speed settings and one without heat. The dryer has silky-touch surface for smooth handling. We have used Andis hair dryers for years. They are used in upscale hotels.|pos
This is a great product.  I didn't really believe all the Ionic hype, but it really does seem to make a difference.  My hair is smoother and softer and dries in much less time (I'd say 30-40% faster).  It is a very hot hair dryer, so be sure to keep it away from your scalp and face.  But, I love it!|pos
excellent my clients love the way theirs hair look and so fare the best investment that I made this year|pos
When I received this dryer I found it a little heavy and the air flow was too strong. Also the buttons are in a weird location  but since it was the second dryer I ordered from Amazon I decided to keep it. Big mistake! Last week it started to eat my hair. I have long hair and the exhaust end of the dryer grabs my hair and rips it off my head. I don't know why this started after a month but now it is too late to return it. Doesn't matter, I won't use it again.|neg
I did a bit of research on the web to get a good price. This does look to be similar to the ANDES product with the same features, but the Sunbeam Hospitality is the dryer I have. I chose this based on 1)Retractable Cord (am using with the Stowaway tray and wanted to be able to adjust the cord length so it didn't get caught in the cupbaord when closing) 2) Tourmaline 3) Not too gigantic.<br /><br />This is much chunkier and larger than I anticipated from the photo, but not enough to annoy me - mainly becuase this is one of the FASTEST dryers I have ever used. Seriously.. And, added bonus, the sound is not obnoxiously high-pitched. My hair is dry in like 4 minutes. With my older hair dryer(s) ...usually after 10mins I stop drying and I have mostly dry hair... with this, I have it on for 4-5 mins and it is completely dry! Love it! You should buy one!|pos
I got this for my daughter cause i have one and she loved it...it got here fast and in perfect condition...she loves it...loves the power.|pos
I have had three of these dryers absolutely fail on me. Even though it was under warranty and they replaced it twice, the last one overheated<br />and broke down again. Three times and you are out, so I will order another manufacturer. GOOD BYE ANDIS|neg
Love the dryer. A funny thing though. I have short hair and the attachment that fluff's up your hair, I have not mastered using it yet. I am afraid I will knock  myself out. My hairdresser and friends laugh at me when I tell them about it. Otherwise, easy to handle and quick to dry.|pos
I bought this unit about 2 months ago. I am retired so I do not use it every day. I have short hair so it has not seen hard duty. Today it began to run erratically. It also gave off a burning smell. My husband checked it out and found the fan motor is giving off heavy blue arcing. This is a piece of garbage and should be removed from the market place. I am dismayed that a name such as CONAIR would sell such junk.|neg
I'm happy with this product. I have long thick hair that normally takes forever to dry. This makes it easier and faster to dry my hair. I'm very satisfied with the Andis Dryer.|pos
This product got fast in a new not opened package with instructions and everything, it is usefull and very light i love it!|pos
Don't waste your money.  Buy something decent.  I have had this dryer only around 4 months and it has burned my hand and my hair because at times it gets so hot.  Almost from day one, sometimes the high setting stops working and will only blow very low and cold.  Then suddenly it will work again. Well I am at work again today with flat hair because ONCE AGAIN the high setting and heat stopped working.  I'm done with this piece of junk.|neg
I picked this hairdryer because of the high reviews on Amazon, and I was not disappointed.  My girlfriend loves this hairdryer.  It feels like a quality item when you hold it in your hands.|pos
This dryer is a great device and works well. It's small and can easily be transported while travelling. It's also powerful and helps to dry hair out.|pos
I bought this for my 5 yea old daughter because she always wants to do things for herself and I wanted to encourage her independence. This is so small and light. She is able to handle it easily and even though I still have to watch her and help with the use of a hairbrush, she is well on her way to independence. It is very powerful for its size and comes with a nice bag and accessories.|pos
I needed a basic, reliable hair dryer.  That is what I got, and I did not over-pay for it.<br /><br />The option for air-only is convenient - in a pinch I was able to dry out a nearly-ruined paycheck without damaging it.|pos
This is a nice blow dryer. It works well, is very solidly built (somewhat heavy for its size, but that doesn't bother me). It is comfortable to hold and just the right size (medium...not to small or big). The highest heat setting is too hot for me (which is a change from my previous blow dryer, but tells me it has good heating elements), so I keep it on medium. For some reason, I thought it was black when I purchased it, but it is a very pretty dark plum color, with pink accents...very &#34;stylish&#34;! :) Oh, and I love the &#34;cool shot&#34; feature!|pos
I have very thick, curly hair and the power in this dryer does the job in great time!  Thank you!|pos
I love this hair dryer.  I love the retractable cord.  The high speed is great!  I was surprised by how quiet it is.|pos
I love this hair dryer.  It fits well in my hand.  Drys my hair beautifully and quickly.  I have fine hair and this dryer is not &#34;too much&#34;.  It has several speeds and heat options.  Would definitely recommend.|pos
We liked this so much, we bought another for our daughter's bathroom so we could get ours back! Very quiet and a reasonable value. The wattage is fine because any higher just cooks your hair anyways..!  Time will tell with durability..|pos
The thing that you put in front isn't their!!! and every time i try to use it it blow half of my hair the other half is flying up!!! hate it!!!|neg
The quality of ionized hair-drying you get with this dryer is no less than top of the line salon dryers like CHI. The build quality of this dryer is better than my CHI that died on me. When I opened the CHI to attempt to repair it, I couldn't believe how cheaply made it was and I was amazed at what the retail markup must be. It's like jewelry, they must be making a fortune...The only reason to buy a CHI over this dryer is if you are a stylist and you have an image to uphold, i.e. pretentious clientele that would look down on you for using a Remington.|pos
I love this powerful light weight dryer. It leaves my hair shinny with lots of body. My granddaughter recommended it to me. She loves her dryer also.|pos
No complaints. It's light and not too noisy. It has 2 blowing speeds and 2 levels of heating which is enough for me to adjust as I need. I am using it for the last 6 month with no problems so far. I got it thru Amazon and happy with it.|pos
I work in a high end salon. I have been doing this for about 10 years. I love the twin turbo brand. I had to send out my 3200 (which i love) for service.  I ordered this one overnight to get me by for a few weeks. I HATE IT. Its not the blowdryer itself but the way the nozzle attaches to it.  It pulls hair like crazy. Everyone in the salon that borrows my dryer hates it too. Im glad my 3200 will be back soon and I will only have to use this as a back up or when I need my assistant to help with an additional blowdryer. Get a 3200 or a 3800 as they do not have this design flaw.|neg
I was trying to replace a hair dryer that had provided faithful performance for many years, and was also quiet. This particular hair dryer seemed like it would fit the bill. It did not. Did not even use it for a whole session. The main problem was that the plug would not stay in the outlet. Any small movement, which is required for drying hair, and the plug would fall out of the outlet. Have never had a problem with the other dryer, or dryers of guests. The other disappointment was how loud it is. I wish that I could find a clone of my old dryer!|neg
I put this in my gym bag and the features make this perfect with folding and retractable cord. Love it.|pos
I would highly recommend this. It is really powerful which is handy for someone with frizzy hair like mine. Good value for such a good product.|pos
Works great @ just the right temp.  Hair never looked better with just a brush and dry.  Love the retractable cord!  Definitely the best dryer I've ever had and at a great price to boot!|pos
The brush was really  not made well.  It was not packaged well (the brush).  The vents should be on the top not on the side.  It will catch your hair.|neg
Hardest blowing hair dryer for the price.  This is the second one we bought. Works great!  Can't go wrong. x|pos
i use it to dry my hair.What a  stupid question or do you have other uses for a wall hanging hair dryer|pos
I have very thick wavy hair, and this has been the best hair drier ever. I bought two in fact so that I do not have to carry with me when I visit with my friends.|pos
I bought this Conair when my old one finally blew.  After 10 year mind you.  I have short hair but need something with a couple heat and blow settings.  This does the trick.  There are two speed settings and three heat.  That gives you enough combinations to do the trick.  Takes me only 5 minutes to dry and style my hair.  It also has a &#34;cool&#34; button which is easy to reach.  The hook on the handle makes it easy to hang if you need to.|pos
I bought this dryer to substitute one that had less h and it did not have a cold operate on it. I think it does an excellent job, and the cold operate is very awesome. It is not as noisy as my old one (which was like a 747 getting in the bathroom). The only issue that I have with it is that it is difficult to convert on and off with one handy. It might just be me but, if a individual had joint disease or RA, this would not be the clothing dryer for them.|pos
After my blow dreyer of 10 years stared to loose it's &#34;umff&#34; I turned to amazon of course so look through some reviews and came across this blow dreyer, my hair stylist, who is a trusted friend even recommended it, and of course even she couldn't beat the price, it works really well, my hair is much smoother after using this dreyer versus my old one, it was definitely time for an upgrade. The power is great and I didn't find it to be to heavy. I have long fine hair and it dried very quickly so that's nice considering I'm a mom with a 14 mo old who doesn't have to much primp time in the mornings :)  I would definitely recommend this dreyer!|pos
Once I used this hair dryer, I noticed how quickly, efficiently and with less noise dried my hair.  I can definitely see a difference with the efficiency when compared to hotel and hair dryers sold at a local drug store.<br /><br />The delivery of the dryer was as promised, delivered promptly.<br /><br />I would recommed this vendor and product to my friends.|pos
I recently bought the HSI flat iron.  I liked it so much I bought the dryer.  I like the dryer just a much.  It is light weight and powerful.  I have long wavy hair and this dryer works quickly without adding frizz.|pos
This is a wonderful product. I like how it has a &#34;coo/warm/hot&#34; switch AND a &#34;low/high&#34; switch and not just one switch making you choose low and cool or hot and high. I also love the little attachment it comes with to give a more concentrated blow to a specific section of hair. I would definitely buy this product again.|pos
Definitely more convenient thatn going to a salon all the time. I love doing my own hair at home now and this has allowed me to spend less time blow drying and styling it.|pos
Love this blowdryer!  Compact, yet powerful!<br />Typically I can't find anything that blows the air strong enough, this is by far the best dryer I have had.|pos
Don't let the cheap price draw you in. This hair dryer is not worth it. I tossed my still working hair dryer that I had owned for 8 years when I bought this. 6 months later it caught on fire. Yes caught on fire on the inside was a bright blue flame and a burning smell. Frightening! Do not buy!|neg
This hair dryer is powerful, quiet by hair dryer standards, and has a solid quality feel to it.  I spent a lot of time researching different options and am happy with my purchase.|pos
Arrived in time. I've only had it for one month so I'm not sure how long it will last but so far I've had no problems. This hair dryer is great. I'm not sure if it is as good as the more expensive brands as I have never paid over $20 for one but it definitely gets the job done. Oh and I looove the retractable cord.|pos
I bought this for my wife, my comments on the result of purchasing this product a year ago:<br /><br />This is not a good for drying, I don't know why the professional word is on the description, next time tell this is for home use, home result, totally different to result my wife get from beauty med level professional.<br /><br />I'm Disappointed with this purchasing, but the time to send this back and get money back.|neg
Great dryer if you don't like the newer types which have gadgets added to them and are very powerful.  This has a powerful setting but not extremely strong so that your hair is getting a beating.|pos
Powerful blowdryer, super light. My mom took this from me (I bought this dryer in 2009- she took it in 2011) and it's still going strong! My mom uses it along with my sister, my niece and 2 of my cousins and they all love it. One thing though, it is so strong you need to make sure to not burn your hair by leaving it on one strand for too long! It's not like a conventional dryer, it will cut your drying time, so use it with that knowledge. If I didn't love my current dryer I'd definitely buy this one when/if it dies.|pos
I love it, my hair is so shiny! it dries faster and I love the attachments, I use the diffuser for my curly hair and the other for my daughters' straight hair, all around great product.|pos
oh my I am so pleased. I had my other Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for 22 years. it went through me and 2 daughters and still works. I don't think it gets as hot as it used to, but never the less. This blower has large shoes to fill. if it last half as long I will be very pleased.|pos
this does what you think it will, dries hair. My wife likes it and she and her sisters use it all the time.|pos
Love this hair dryer, light weight lots of power!! Great value for the money.  I have paid alot more for other hair dryers with less power.|pos
NO complaints here! I say buy this one . Its a great hairdryer. and I go thru them. SO good product!!|pos
This is a great dryer.  The three settings, low, medium and high allow for more flexibility when styling your hair.  My hair  is fine so the low and  medium setting work great for me!|pos
this hair dryer was worth the money. The quality is good without breaking the wallet. Also, the size is optimal, very small, easy to handle and operate.|pos
Ordered it online as ssonas I returned.  I love the retractable feature. It is the best hair dryer I've ever had.|pos
I bought this for my daughter 5 months ago. She loves it especially over the one she used to borrow from me. It dries her hair very fast and the folding handle and retractable cord make it great for travel. I am thinking of getting one for myself once mine dies knowing this is a good one.|pos
Great price, great item. She loves it. This is professional quality , she uses it at home and for work as well.|pos
I really like that the cord retracts.  Good force of air.  Nice that you can change speeds and/or heat settings.  I like that you can set it to cool or if you are using a heat you could do a blast of cool with the button.  Slightly heavier than I would like but not unreasonably so.|pos
I love this little hairdryer.....travels well, small, and lightweight.  It is powerful enough for me, and has diffuser, too.  Has 2 settings for temp.  Good value and easy to handle.|pos
I am in hotel industry - I could buy thousands of these. Super cheap, very quiet, with a nice night light, barely use any electricity, great heat, simple to use, VERY comfortable in hand. I've never seen a guest use their own brought hair-dryer. they ALWAYS elect to use this - and it's obviously installed very conveniently in the bathroom - good screws and installation instructions that come with it. Never falls off, always there when you need your hair fluffy.|pos
I love to keep my hair looking shinny and healthy and in the winter it gets dull and in the summer it looks fried.  I live in California.  This neat little gaget givese the conveinceof doing a deep condition at home for just the cost of the conditioner and a shower cap instead of paying those heavy prices at the salon. and it onlytakes 15 minutes and I can do it my PJ's instead of getting all dressed up and and over paying a salon for what I can do for a few bucks.|pos
Hey All,<br />I am not so blessed with fine, thin hair that unless its pinned up and perfectly coifed its a frizzy, fly away mess.  This hair dryer changed that! With its settings and cool air, I can dry it and leave it. No more constant pinned up hair. I can let my locks down! SO yes. I highly recommend it. Its not perfect, Its a little bulky and takes some getting used too (you might have to change how you dry your hair) And I don't recommend traveling with it. BUT for a good stay at home dryer that works like a charm, has easy to use settings I love it -So much that I sent one to my sister :)|pos
This Hair Dryer has a nice color, and has been working so good.<br />So far so good!!!<br />The turbo velocity is quick drying. Is comfortable to use and easy to handling.|pos
my hair looks so dry after i use it. i am very disappointed. i would of returned it but i lost the return slip!|neg
I purchased this blowdryer from Amazon and it only lasted 1 year and I only used it every 2 - days!  Junk - don't buy it.  The retractable cord did not work after a while too but I could have lived with that...|neg
For a small, compact hair dryer its great for traveling! I have little time and thick, curly hair and it does a great job and very powerful. Reasonable price, traveling case and attachments, very happy!|pos
Having used numerous blow dryers in my business, I have to say this has been one of my favorites for so many reasons. It's lightweight and I can actually carry on a conversation with my clients without having to lower the speed...love the design! I highly recommend this product and would purchase again.|pos
It's the little amenities that make a big difference. Our club shower room was bare bones, so I decided to splurge and add a few things including this dryer.  It was easy to install, and the night light is a great feature for people who use the shower room after dark. So far it's working fine.|pos
I just love my Conair 1875 Blow Dryer.  It's more powerful than any blow dryer that I've ever purchased.  I have long hair that generally takes 15 minutes to dry with my Revlon 1875.  The Conair is three times more powerful and dries my hair in less than 5 minutes.  And it's great for travel because it folds in half and is very, very light in weight.  I happily give this dryer 5 stars and would give it 10 if the option was available.|pos
Works well for my wife, it's not fancy, but it does the job well. If you're looking for an inexpensive hair dryer, this is the one.|pos
Andis makes a great product, and I have a white Andis full-sized dryer for the house, but I needed a smaller one for on-the-road travel in my semi truck. This also has dual voltage for overseas travel, so YAY! Get one.|pos
The dual wattage feature saves you from having to use a converter. The unit is very small yet plenty powerful, and way better than the dryers provided in hotels. For my hairstyle, the air concentrator attachment is a must. I'm very pleased with this dryer.|pos
Salon quality dryer.  Great size and color. Love that its so quite. I've had to adapt to the controls being on the outside of the handle.(my old one was on the inside) but it's well worth it.  My hair dries so fast I have extra time in the mornings.. Love it, Love it, Love it.<br />I would reccomend this dryer to anyone that wants a quality dryer. Four year warranty. Where can you find that on a hair dryer?|pos
I used the 'soft touch' black version of this hair dryer at a high-end resort hotel once and I was immediately in love, so I had to get this (white) one on Amazon. It had so much power for such a small dryer!! Highly recommended.|pos
Love how quiet this dryer is.  It feels good in the hand however it is a bit on the heavy side.  You get used to it after using it for awhile.  Other than the weight issue it is an amazing dryer!|pos
great product I recommend everyone get one. It is a good compact devise that is easy to travel with, you can put it under your seat or just hold it in your lap.|pos
it does a good job in a short amount of time and that it exactly why i bought this.  good dryer|pos
Had one that finally wore out and loved it so much bought another one just like it! You don't have to worry where to put it, it's on the wall!|pos
I have thick curly hair that I straighten twice a week. This hair dryer makes it easy! I highly recommend it!|pos
Returned this as the hot was lukewarm at best. I then bought a Conair Infinit Pro at a local store which seems much better heat wise.<br /><br />edited May 19, 2013: Returned the Infiniti Pro as well and bought a Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer. As I posted in my review for the Remington (which I didn't buy on Amazon but was so happy with it I wanted to write a review about it):<br /><br />I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn't get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.|neg
Great dryer to replace an old wall mounted one. Heat settings are very good and installation was easy and fast|pos
I truly don't understand anyone who would pay more or could want more than what this hair dryer offers.  It's fantastic.  The settings, noise level, weight, what it does to my hair - all of it.  It's great.|pos
I cannot believe I spent this much on a hairdryer, but I do really like it much better than the one I got at the large chain store. Wish it cost less, but would probably buy it again... ( :|pos
I received this product and am very happy with it.  It is so powerful that even with my very think hair, it is dry within minutes.  By far the best product I own for drying my hair.|pos
This was purchased to replace the one that got stomped (by accident). It is of a very professional quality, without the high price tag.|pos
Great hairdryer the wife is very happy. I went with this one because it had many reviews and seemed popular|pos
I LOVE IT!!! IT IS JUST PERFECT. MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE IN LOVE WITH IT. I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT 100%|pos
I don't use my hair dryer for much more than drying purposes... Lol... It's simple, in-expensive, and it blows a lot of hot air... ;)<br /><br />It serves its purpose well...|pos
I hesitated to spend this much money on a hair dryer, and I am so happy I did.  I have always purchased the cheaper drug store ones and they not worth it- my hair is so much smoother and healthier with this dryer!|pos
Loved the color, works amazingly well. Dries your hair very fast. I love that there are multiple setting for temperature and speed|pos
I am a hairstylist, and I love this dryer! It is lightweight, and it dries my hair incredibly fast. The cord is a little short for professional use, but I love it for myself!|pos
this hairdryer is a super product!  i would recommend this item to everyone! it is light weight and has a strong enough power to take my frizzes away in just a few minutes..|pos
This hair dryer replaced one my Mom had been using for the past 25 years or so. I finally convinced her it was time when the old one was broken in so many places I just could not fix it anymore though the motor was fine.  She loves the new one because it resembles the old one in so mnay ways but with improvements.  She is delighted with this Conair HH320LR.. Could not be more pleased.|pos
This was perfect for my trip.  Even when I did not realize I had to turn the dial to a different voltage in Singapore - it just flipped the breaker and did not burn out the dryer.  When I was finally smart enough to realize I needed to select the voltage I could not have been happier.  I have long hair and like to dry my hair upside down at times.  I hate when my hair gets caught in the fan.  This dryer had the perfect cover and my hair never got caught or tangled.  It folds up for easy packing too.|pos
I am very happy with this hair dryer. I must agree with others, though, the night light is very bright. I read other reviewers who said it was bright, but I couldn't imagine such a small light being so bright. My dryer is in a bathroom off the bedroom and it lights up all the bathroom and part of the bedroom. I covered the light with 2 thickness of duck tape and it is still very bright. I like having the night light, but it could be a &#34;bit&#34; dimmer. The dryer works fine and I like having a place to hang the cord on the dryer so it doesn't lay on the sink. That is a great feature.|pos
Fantastic little hair dryer I bought for my trip later this year. I've only been able to work it on the 250 setting here in Australia, but it seems great so far. Make sure if you're Australian and you plug it in with the adapter that you don't put it on high! I didn't read the instructions and nearly blew it up haha. Can only be used on low here, but that's fine as it's for my trip to the US anyways. Was quite powerful and I think it'll be perfect.|pos
For months now, I've been blaming my flat iron on burning a large section of my hair- until today- when I was blow drying , as usual, and smelled something, then saw a gray spot on my head- upon closer inspection, realized it was a singed section of my hair, and as I ran my fingers through it- sadly, many hairs fell to the floor.<br />So the good new is, I can keep using my flat iron.  The bad news- who thought this hair dryer was so bad for your hair!  I have a huge section of dry, burned hair that I have been growing out for months- but always wondered why there always seemed to be new broken hairs with singed marks on the end.  Buying a new one tomorrow- but NEVER this brand again.|neg
I use this hairdryer 3-4 times a week. Great power and is quite nice...plus it's in my favorite color, red.|pos
I always bought this particular model at Wal Mart.  Wal Mart no longer carries this dryer.  This dryer lasts much longer then any other hair dryer I have used.  That is why I keep buying the Vidal Sassoon Ion dryer.|pos
Its good, dryes my hair really fast and its cute too! I got 2 one for me and one for my friend she loves it as well!|pos
I bought this for a trip to Italy and it worked great for me.  It's very small but also very powerful.  I have a lot of thick curly hair so a need a good hairdryer.  I also bought the diffuser attachment.  I actually think it's better than the hairdryer I use at home!  You will need an adaptor but it has a voltage converter so it works much better than hairdryers that don't have a voltage converter.  Worth the extra bucks.|pos
I first used this hair dryer at a friend's cabin and I was hooked. The motor is quiet, the dryer itself is pretty light, the blow is intense, and the best part? It gets super hot. You can barely hold your hand under it for too long. I immediately went home and bought it online. I have a medium bob and the dry time was cut in half. My hair seemed fuller and shinier. My roommate was so jealous that she ran out and bought one as well. We both are big into hair tools and are now the biggest fan of this hair dryer. I came upon it in Costco for such a good deal, that I bought another one!<br /><br />The only downside to this dryer, is that it does not come with the defuser attachment. Please, Conair, gimme a defuser!<br /><br />I would recommend this dryer to anyone with hair.|pos
My wife used it at a hotel for several days and wanted one for home use.  It met and exceeded her expectations|pos
I purchased this hairdryer because it's the one my beautician uses !I LOVED how fast it was to blowdry my hair !!I got the travel one too !! LOVE IT LOVE !! FAST SHIPPING TOO !! THANK YOU !!|pos
I LOVE this hair dryer! I bought one for myself and others as gifts after trying this at a Marriott hotel. It dries my hair so fast and for the price you can't beat that! It is light and love the retractible cord. After a while you have to push the cord in yourself but I've had it for over a year and use it everyday so it is definitely durable. I wish it came with a diffuser and other nozzles like some of the other hairdryers but if your looking for an inexpensive but reliable product, this is it!|pos
I bought this as a gift for Christmas.  I really liked the idea of a power cord that would retract into the unit, and honestly, that was a key point in choosing this over other models.  Well, the retracting mechanism worked perfectly once or twice.  After that, it would take 2-3 tries to get it to retract the cord all the way.  Usually, it would stop roughly mid-way.  After a couple months of that silliness, it now won't retract more than half way no matter how much you fuss with it.  This hair dryer was barely used at all before this bad behavior started.<br /><br />Do you remember those terrible roller window shades we had back in the 70's?  You know the ones.. they were ugly white and every time you tried to make the shade go up all the way, you'd struggle?  You'd pull it a tiny bit and hope it'd release the mechanism and pull up, but instead, it'd pull out a little more each time until finally you had that sucker pulled all the way down to the floor?  Well, if you enjoyed that nice nugget of frustration, please buy this hair dryer!<br /><br />Other observations:<br />- The release button is in an awkward position, so even when this was working, it was an awkward 2-handed affair.<br />- The noise seems a little less than a typical hair dryer.  But then again, the airflow seems a little less too.  Same goes for the heat.<br /><br />Honestly, I can't believe I took the time today to get online and review a silly hair dryer.  It just frustrates me so much that I had to do it just in the hope that I might save someone else the trouble of experiencing this thing.|neg
After 8 years this dryer finally became brittle and began chipping near the fan so it was time for a new one.  I had no reservations  buying this same make & model..matter of fact I bought two this time....one will stay in the luggage ready to hit the road.|pos
works great for me, i dont need anything fancy but this one has everything i needed. the attachments help for random things as well|pos
Dries my thick hair in no time.  I love it and wish I would have bought it sooner.  It's worth the money.|pos
This does exactly what I need it to, it's really quiet which is nice, but still does it's job. Quick drying process and I have notoriously hard to dry hair, so I'm please with this purchase. It doesn't get too hot like other dryers I haven't had any issues with burning myself by staying on one spot too long.|pos
This product arived on time and is a very powerful dryer for the price, all the pieces are very sturdy as well, what I did not like was that in the picture the pieces looked white, which was my main reason for the purchase, but the pieces  obviously pink up close.|pos
This is one of the best blow dryers we have purchased.  I am going to buy another one to keep in our travel bag.|pos
Works as advertised.  Can't beat the price for a quality product such as this one.  One of the better buys out there.|pos
It has a lot of power.  Easy to hold and small enough to be easy to pack for a trip|pos
I've had T3 products before...my last T3 hair dryer lasted 3 years and change. I purchased this one less than 5 months ago and it is already shorting out on me. The dryer simply drops in intensity within a minute of using. Very disappointed.<br />Since the warranty with the seller had already expired (one month!) I contacted T3 Micro for repairs/replacements. Turns out this unit was either refurbished or a knock-off because the serial number on the dryer did NOT match the serial number on the box. And to top it off, both serial numbers were INVALID!! WTF...scam and fraud much!!?? Stay away!|neg
I received this hair dryer on March 23 and it is already broken!  No heat at all.  Not a good deal.|neg
The settings are wonderful and my hair did feel a lot softer after using! The heat setting are great too... I like the option of having cool, warm and hot... the dryer is super powerful and definitely cut down on drying time. And the retractable cord is great! I would definitely recommend this blow dryer to a friend!|pos
ive always really liked the travel sized blow dryers. and this one is wonderful not to heavy and drys my hair in half the time.|pos
My old hair dryer died a rather spectacular death with sparks and smoke.  I hadn't researched hair dryers before, and I only wanted something that would dry my hair.  So I randomly picked a conair from a local store.  I used it a few times and was not happy with the results for the conair.  It turned out to be loud as all get out, and my hair turned out flat.  I felt like I was in a deafening windstorm.  So now I had a criteria for research:  Something that was quiet and didn't blow my hair into a limp state.  That's what lead me to this Remington.  It shipped and got here quickly.  Yes, it smelled a bit funny as all new hair appliances do when first used, but I was impressed.  It was easy to handle.  I liked that I didn't have to keep sliding buttons up and down to change settings like my old hair dryer.  It was relatively quiet as hair dryers go.  The drying process went very quickly.  My hair had plenty of volume with a smooth, soft feeling when all was said and done.  I'm very happy.  No flat hair and my ears aren't ringing.  I highly recommend the Remington hair dryer.|pos
Googled hair dryer, found it at Amazon.com one of my trusted sites. Ordered it and got it 4 days ago. It is better than the old one as this model has an led night light built in. Great Product. Working fine.<br /><br />Thanks<br />Amazon|pos
I love the blow dryer it works great. it was a little heavier than I thought it would be but is great.|pos
Product arrived as expected and was a bargain price. I just used it for the first time and am very happy with purchase. I kept it on low setting, which was enough for my hair. The cooling button works fast to cool off curls created by your brush. Would highly recommend item.|pos
Best hair dryer I have ever used!  I bought it b/c I used it at a hotel and I love it!  I have had it for about a month and it works great.  It dries hair quickly, but is gentle and doesn't damage my hair.  I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a hair dryer that is great for your hair,!|pos
Works great and my little girl loves having her own blow dryer! It is a very cute and functional blow dryer!|pos
Fabulous - had one before that lasted 9 years.  Hope this one lasts as long.  So easy just to grap off the wall instead of searching through drawers for regular hair dryers. Hotel style - very convenient.|pos
Oozes quality. Easy to maneuver to any direction. Relatively quiet and extra long cord. i really have been spoiled by it!|pos
This product was worth every penny! It will work for any hair type and saves so much time. There's nothing better than not having to use your arms while drying your hair. The ionic button is the best feature, which helps prevent all frizz :)))|pos
I was previously using a compact hair dryer that did more damage to my hair.  With the included nozzles, the adjustable temperature and adjustable air power, my hair is smoother and dries a lot quicker than before.  The cold air button is also a plus if you're round brushing your hair.  The non-slip coating on the dryer makes holding the device very comfortable.  HSI is powerful and works wonderfully.  Love it.|pos
The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.  After a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time, I just had to order it.  I got the regular and travel size.  Love them both.|pos
this is a great product I would recommend it to all my friends that own salon it's easy it's lightweight and it last|pos
shonnila<br />Excellent Product at an Excellent Price! The first time I used it my husband said my hair looked like it had a salon finish.....Love it!|pos
This is a great dryer. As a male, I don't use all the &#34;fancy&#34; options that this hair dryer comes with. I simply use it for 30 seconds after I come out of the shower and it works great. The two selling points that I bought this dryer is because of Amazon Prime and the low price compared to other hair dryers.|pos
I never actually thought that a hairdryer could be different from any other hair dryers. Unbeknownst to me, I was sorely mistaken. This keeps the static out! And I admit that I have quite a mane of hair, and this drys it in record speeds. A lot of customization with temp/speed/air flow. Highly recommended.|pos
I like most Conair products. They heat up quickly and they are mostly very good products. But, this stupid hair bonnet dryer is the worst thing yet. Don't buy.|neg
This hair dryer is amazing. It has the perfect temperatures and blow strength. For thick hair that takes long to dry, this is a miracle! And it's very sturdy, firm, robust. It seems that a made a very good choice!|pos
So my previous 1875 watt ionic dryer started making my hair frizzy and finally died on me. I was looking around for a new one and found that my favorite brand in hair products made a cute stylish hair dryer. It doesn't just look nice, it works amazing too. I love how it has a setting for hot and warm. I haven't had a hair dryer with that option yet. I also really like the switch, rather than a sliding one. I have no complaints and I highly recommend it. It dries quickly and I have no frizzies and my hair looks so much better with this dryer compared to my old Revlon. It's great for drying my curlies and works just as well for blowouts, too.|pos
I bought this for my mom, who has had issues with blow dryers melting her fine-textured hair. She loves this one! It dries her hair very fast and doesn't melt your hair like other blow dryers can. The retractable cord is very nice as well and the dryer doesn't feel cheap. If you're in the market for a new dryer, give this one a try.|pos
Purchased this blow dryer based on a recommendation from my hair stylist. One of the best investments I've made in years. Powerful but light enough to maneuver easily. It doesn't weigh your arm down. Worth every penny.|pos
I purchased this hair dryer after seeing the raving reviews and it is indeed true. I have long thick hair and it certainly dries my hair a lot quicker than the other dryers. In addition, the heat is not too strong and this is helpful as it does not dry out the root too much at the same time dries the hair just right with a good flow of air. I'm very satisfied and highly recommend! This is a good buy...|pos
I read the reviews on this product from other customers before I purchased this dryer.  I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer! I have owned several hairdryers over the years and have even been known to burn up a few...  This dryer gets my thick hair completely dry and frizz-free in under 3 minutes.  I use product and a round brush and have been very pleased with this dryer.  It is quiet and doesn't get too hot.  I love the adjustable heat and speed settings.  I also use the concentrator attachment to channel the air.  I was unable to find this product at any local retailers (Walmart and Target are the two I checked) and i think it is better than the Conair Infinity X pro model.  If you need a dryer that gets your hair dry quickly and with minimal frizz, this is the one for you.|pos
This hair dryer arrived in good time and worked as advertised. My wife loves that it hangs on the wall in our bathroom. She finds it very convenient. Would not hesitate to deal with this company again.|pos
I purchased this item from Super Pharmacy Unica on February 26, 2013.  I received this item at the beginning of March 2013.  I have used this hai rdryer probably six or eight times since receiving.  Yesterday I had to dry my hair ao I turned the dryer on and smoke began to pour out of the on, off switch.  I immediately turned it off .  I sent an email to the seller and I have not received a reply.  I have used Yellowbird hair dryers which I have purchased from other vendors for many years and I have never had a problem with this brand of hair dryer.  Furthermore, this seller has not replied to any of my emails.  I want my money returned so that I can purchase a new Yellowbird hair dryer from a reputable company.|neg
I ordered the Onei MK-II Air Ionique Hair Dryer for my wife just over a week ago and she is thrilled with it.  She loves the variable temperature feature.  The first time she used the dryer she said &#34;My hair looks GREAT!&#34;  I would certainly recommend this dryer.  The price is excellent for a professional-quality dryer and it's strongly constructed.  Also, the shipping service was amazing.  I ordered standard shipping, thinking the dryer would arrive in five or ten days, but it arrived in just two days.|pos
this is a very good hair dryer. It doesn't mess up my hair. Very good product. I would definitely recommend it.|pos
Ok, so we all know that we can't pack a lot of heavy things.<br />This little dryer will save a lot of pounds and it works great.|pos
This hair dryer is the best I've owned!  I have dry, curly hair and this hair dryer is powerful enough to straighten my hair without burning it... I'm very happy with my purchase and will tell all of my friends about it...|pos
I moved to USA recently, and needed everything for my house. This dryer was a perfect combination of price and quality.|pos
This blow dryer is very efficient. The retractable cords are convenient and I have no malfunctioning problems at all. The colour is bright and pretty. I think I got my money's worth.|pos
I was looking for a folding handle hair dryer with a retractable cord and this one is perfect! It has more features than I expected, based on the online description. I was pleased to find out there are multiple temperature and speed settings, and it is so much more quiet than other hair dryers I've purchased. I love it!|pos
This dryer arrived quickly and was packaged well.  I replaced my old dryer that was similar to this one but this one is lighter and easier to style your hair with.  Itdries your hair quickly too.  I don't need it on the highest setting for too long.  It came with a concentrator and a diffuser.|pos
This hair dryer is awesome! I read many reviews about it online. And I am so glad I listened and bought this. You will not be sorry....it's great! It heats up, has a retractable cord and folds for easy storage.|pos
As other reviewers said, it is light and quiet. These are two things that really impressed me. Plus it does a good job drying my hair.|pos
I forgot to take my hairdryer with me when visiting a friend.  She had this dryer in her guest bathroom and after using it for a few times, I said:  this is the most wonderful little dryer -  I have to get one.  It is so powerful and makes drying not only quick but blows in lots of volume.  I bought one for my home in FL and a second one to take home to my MI home this summer.  I was so happy to locate it so easily by just going to Amazon!|pos
I discovered this while on vacation recently.  All of the hotels we have stayed in recently have had this blow dryer available for guests.  It's light weight, fairly quiet, and the variable temperatures sold me.  It also has a cool button which is fantastic when it's hot.  I actually ordered this from Amazon while still on vacation so it would be at my home when I returned.|pos
It works with it's 3 settings, Hot Warm and Cool. It's also pretty strong and dries my hair quickly (I have long hair). I only wish it came with that angled head attachment so you can blow in a direction.|pos
I plug it and it doesn't work. Just bought it and I never used it before. What do I do with it.|neg
LOVE IT LEFT MY HAIR SOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL LIKE IN THE SALON<br />DOES NOT OVER HEAT<br />AND ITS SMALL LIGHTWEIGH POWERFUL BUT DONT LET THE SIZE AND WEIGHT MISGUIDE YOU ITS A POWERFUL THING LIKE A PLANE OR CAR OR BOAT....LOVE IT. I USE IT ON MY HAIR ON M MOMS HAIR ON MY COUSINS HAIR AND ON MY SISTERS HAIR AND ON MY 2 DOGS HAIR I WOULD USE IT ON MY DADS HAIR BUT HES BALD LOL LOVE IT.... GET IT ASAP YOU CANT GO WRONG|pos
I highly recommend this hair dryer for anyone, it is light weight and dries my hair very quickly.<br />It does not burn my hair like the old hair dryers.|pos
Arrived and works great - good power, great price, and arrived in the exact time frame and all intact - good buy.|pos
I like it very much, for hair drying, it works very well. The two accessories are not so often used anyway.|pos
bought this product for my mom for christmas, she needs a new one every year, i dont know what she does but they all end up going out. this Andis 8200 hair dryer has hung in there and it still works great. i would highly recommend it. its also very pretty in person, the color is great.|pos
looks good, but stopped working after 3 months, It's beyond producr return time, so I cannot return and waste of money.|neg
I found the dryer too heavy and bulky for travel and it didn't fold for compact storage.  Skip this one!|neg
Love this dryer! I have very thick, unmanageable hair but with this bad boy it goes from super frizzed out to soft and shiny. It's not heavy at all and I haven't had any problems with it overheating or shorting out (sounds like operator errors to me). Definitely worth the money and the wait.|pos
Works extremely well. Dried my hair in a third of the time it takes with my old hair dryer. I recommend you spend an extra 20 bucks and buy this hair dryer instead of buying a cheap brand. It's a great deal!!!!|pos
We have had numerous hair dryers, this is def. one of the best. Forceful air and the cord retractor has worked great so far. Very satisfied, one note is while pushing the retract cord button, hold the cord as it goes in so it doesnt whip around.|pos
I love this blow dryer, helps me when styling my hair. Comes with 2 connectors for styling and love using them both. Great product for the value and I like the color. The retractable cord is a big plus too.|pos
I would not recommend this product as it is not well manufactured nor does it last for a good period of time. It is not a good investment of your money.|neg
I replaced my 13-year old Conair hair dryer with this one.  I love it!  The efficiency cuts my dry time probably in half.  The dryer is HEAVY, but it is not a problem for me.  I would also be careful of the retractable cord - it can fly all over the place and hit you or something else.  I have had the dryer for several months now, and so far no problems mechanically.  I'm hoping it will last as long as my last one!|pos
No problems and drys my hair well. There are only two settings, however the temperatures are great. The low gets hot enough and the high gets hot. The shipment was really a big surprise. I received this product within two days time from ordering it.|pos
I used it in New Zealand and Australia and it worked great with plenty of heat and power. I was glad to have the voltage change switch.|pos
You can't use this dryer without a net or curlers. Will not dry natural hair styles because it sucks air from the bottom through the top and if your hair isn't kept down the fan will suck it upwards? And yes the dingger is loud.|neg
my twin sister loved it she need one so i gave it to her as a gift,thanks i would give it as gifts|pos
I battled with myself over spending this much on a hairdryer, and I'm so glad that I did. Twice I have used it to blow out my hair and my thin, fine hair looks amazing with little need for touch ups with a straightener, NO fly aways.  When I decided to try the diffuser and wear my hair curly, I was hesitant because my Conair would leave my hair super frizzy.  Not with the T3, I had beautiful curls, frizz-free.  Don't let the lighter air flow throw you, this little baby has lots of drying power.  Great size, lightweight, and the velcro cord keeper is helpful when ready to put away.|pos
I love this blow dryer! I was hesitant to spend more than $20, but so glad I did! I have naturally curly hair and I notice my hair is way less frizzy! I did not notice it being heavy at all. Seemed same weight as my old blow dryer. The noise is about average. I wouldn't say it is quiet, but it's not too loud either. About the same as any other hair dryer I've used.|pos
Drys my hair quickly. My hair is thick this dryer cuts my time in half. I would recommend it for anyone.|pos
super sleek looking.<br />works great!<br />cold air gives out cold air n hot gives out hot. if you know what i mean. not like those hair dryers that give warm air when you want cold.<br /><br />good investment|pos
es practico y bueno... encantada con el producto desde vargas venezuela<br />se los recomiendo.. el producto llego en buen estado|pos
this was recommended by my hairdresser and it is all I expected.  It dries my hair!!!  faster and most likely won't konk out in a few years.|pos
In the days when I had hair to blow dry,most handhelds just either were too hot,or just plain sucked. I got this for my wife and she has beautiful thick hair,if she's happy with it,it's a winner!|pos
we purchased these after using in a hotel.<br />great and compact.<br />just bought 5 more for our second home baths so our guests will have them too.|pos
I've been using the same blow dryer since high school, and recently it caught fire, so that was that. I spent a long time reading reviews and comparing prices trying to find a new blow dryer and I eventually decided on this one after I was able to go to Target and see it outside of the box in person. This dryer is really awesome, it drys my hair fast, doesn't seem to cause too much damage to my hair and I love the rubberized feel of it while holding it. It doesn't have a lot fancy options or anything, just your generic three heat levels, three blow settings, and a cool button. However, my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning, she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer. She asked how much I paid for it, and after telling her, she indicated that she couldn't believe how well it worked. She also complained that she had recently had to buy a new blow dryer for work and she couldn't see much of a difference between hers and mine expect about $100.|pos
This hair dryer is the best one I have been able to find! I have very long and thick hair. It used to take me about and hour and a half to dry my whole head, this dryer got it dry in...wait for it.... About 25 minutes! Old dryers would leave my hair super frizzy! But this blow dryer left my hair almost board straight. I almost didn't have to use the HSI straightener that I bought along with it. I never used to blow dry my hair because of the time it would take plus how frizzy it would leave my hair but now I have blown dried my hair every single time! Totally worth it!|pos
This does not get hot enough to straighten your hair...takes forever to dry your hair. Not using it. It IS quiet though.|neg
I LOVE this blow dryer. It really is quieter than any other one I've owned. The attachments that come with it are great, and it cuts down a ton on frizz.<br /><br />I love that the handle folds up for easy storage, and it's really lightweight. You don't feel like your arm is going to fall off while drying your hair. It's also pretty quick. I have thick, straight hair that goes halfway down my back, and it takes around 10 minutes to dry.|pos
I only wish that I had bought this blow dryer when ever they first came out...my hair drys in more than half of the time faster....excellent product...|pos
I used one of these hair dryers at a hotel back in 2008 and when we returned from our trip I immediately ordered 2. I recently dropped the original one and broke it so had to get the backup second one I had ordered out to use. Then I ordered another back up just in case. I have been caught short before (by different brands) and had to go to an event with wet hair. That will never happen again since I always keep a backup now.<br />Gets the job done and it is a nice light dryer, packs easy. Just love these. Never stop carrying them, please!|pos
I use it everyday. It works great. No problems. Good Price. I got one for every bathroom.  Good power. easy buy.|pos
Love this hair dryer.  Everything as described.  Seriously people, hold the plug while you push the button to retract and no one gets hurt!|pos
I ordered this product because I heard from a number of friend how great it was. I have curly hair so I also ordered the diffuser to match it. I used it once to dry my hair, it was okay (not as I was told it would be). I then tried my diffuser, I used it 2 times. I went to pull the diffuser off to go back to the drying piece, the blow-dryer completely  fell apart. I noticed that the blow-dryer is made out of card board inside- THAT IS SO DANGEROUS!! I tried to get a refund from the 3rd party vendor and they replied by saying &#34;throw away the item, we will mail out a replacement!&#34; I wrote back and demanded my money!! I never heard back from them so AMAZON luckily refunded my money. For a dryer that is over 100$, this is ridiculous.<br /><br />My mistake was to not read the reviews. I am writing this to save people money, don't do it! I believe the blow dryer I got is a knock-off and I would hope these people selling them are caught and prosecuted.|neg
After spending another vacation week in a Hilton using this wonderful dryer, I knew it would be disappointing to go home and not have one. Its compact, perfect heat settings (2) and so easy to use. The cord is the perfect length. I never take a blowdryer with me when I travel because I just love these wall mounted ones by Sunbeam. You have one button to push to turn it on and then when you're done, just put the dryer back into its holder and it automatically turns off. Its easy to clean, and easy to change the wattage setting. I mounted it near my mirror and the nightlight which I thought would not be a good thing, turns out to be so perfect in the middle of the night. Having two heat settings as far as inside the dryer to save electricity is great for those that want a softer not as hot two-setting dryer or those that are trying to save money among other things. Its perfect, I gave away my other dryer and never looked back.<br /><br />Get it, you'll love it, really I promise.|pos
My Sister got one for Christmas and I borrowed it from her.....fell in love with it! My hair is thick and it dries in less time than my other one.|pos
we have a tiny bathroom with no storage.this hair dryer is so perfect.it's out of the way when not in use.does not take up drawer space.even has a night light.|pos
For the price it is really great. I like this product..it would be nice if it could be adjusted more than two settings but it is very handy and dries hair very fast. (I suppose the more expensive one have more settings) It does get very hot. When your done it just pops back in the wall holder and the cord hangs up on the knob so it's out of the way.|pos
Good power with very low noise.  Robust design.  The Night light does the job well. The dryer was easy to install.|pos
Perfect hair dryer, does the job. Comes with 2 add-on's for scrunching hair or blowing it out straight. The retractable cord is a space-saver life-saver!|pos
I saw this in People Style and wanted to try it.  I have long thick hair and it cut my drying time in half.  It's perfect and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.|pos
This hair dryer works really fast on Turbo and my hair feels very soft when it's dry.  I really like it!|pos
Having this wall mount hair dryer has ben a real convience, It reduces a lot of cluter around the sink It works and looks well. One of the better things I have purchased.|pos
My hair is so soft with this dryer and it doesnt frizz out.  Also, it isnt as loud as my previous cheaper dryer.|pos
I purchased this dryer in September of 2012. It is now April 2013 and the dryer is on its last legs. It still runs, but it powers down to a lower setting while trying to use the high setting. I expect it to quit all together soon.|neg
This Pro Bonnet Style Dryer shipped fast from the seller and was easy to assemble.  It is whisper quiet and does a great job drying hair evenly.  I recommend this product.|pos
Have been using the yellow bird dryer for a least 20 years.  It's the best blow dryer on the market bt conair|pos
I suffer from carpal tunnell syndrome.  I have had surgery but still have no strength for long periods of time.  Holding my hair dryer was really hard to do over a minute or two.  This product saved the day.  It is sturdy and accomodates my blowdryer really well even though it is a big one.  I would most certainly recomend this product to anyone.|pos
I have three teenage daughters so recently I purchased three different hair dryers from Amazon. Imagine my surprise when I realized two were essentially identical except for the price, the length of the cord and the brand name. The Pro Beauty Tools 5885 Professional Lightweight Hair Dryer is the exact same as the Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black by Revlon. Both of these hair dryers are made by Helen of Troy. Both have the same handle, body, and heat/speed options.  Both have the exact same Intertek number (3175842). The major difference is the Pro Beauty Tools hair dryer does have a cord that is 2' longer than the Revlon dryer and it (the Pro Beauty Tools) has an extra filter included. For the $10 difference in price (Pro Beauty Tools higher) one can decide if these options are worth the extra cash. In my opinion both of these items are a FIVE STAR item for price and performance.|pos
Ok, yes, it is a little bulky, but it's because it has tons (and I mean tons!) of power, which you can easily control so you don't burn your hair. The cord can be &#34;sucked in&#34; in 2 secs and then just put the whole thing away. Beautiful!|pos
During our last vacation, one of the hotels had this dryer.  I loved how different it was and how my hair looked after using it.  I wrote down the name and model number.  When I came home, I looked it up and bought one.<br /><br />I didn't think one dryer was different from another.  I was wrong.  I use this every day and it doesn't disappoint.|pos
This hairdryer was a fine replacement (while it lasted) for my wife's old (used for 8+years!) Conair dryer that she loved.  She figured sticking with Conair would be a safe bet, given how long her mini travel dryer had lasted.  WRONG.  She had this one less than a year before the plug box started repeatedly shorting out whenever it was plugged in.  (We've never had any problems with other appliances plugged into the same outlet, including other hairdryers).  Ultimately, the plug box started smoking from the repeated shorts whenever the prongs touched outlet.  She just had to toss it and will have to buy another one far sooner than she expected she'd have to.  Conair should make better quality products than this!|neg
This is one of my best purchases of the year thus far. I'm very happy to have purchased it as it has changed the texture of my hair tremendously. I never knew how much a blow dryer can have such an effect to the results of your hair. My hair is so smooth, soft, and shiny. I use to dread blow drying my hair and instead forfeited it altogether. I would only blow dry on special occasions and preferred air drying because I have very long and thick hair so it would take my full hair to dry 30-45 minutes and even then there would be spots still damp, my hair would get caught in the vent, it was EXTREMELY hot under the blow dryer....basically it was more of a hassle to blow dry my hair. With the T3 it is so pleasant and 10 times quicker to dry. I love the efficiency and ease the T3 provides as well as the amazing results.<br /><br />I had my mother try my dryer out so she could feel the difference and she was instantly converted. She commented she never knew that a blow dryer could make such a difference. [We are use to buying cheaper dryers because we didn't think a more expensive dryer made a difference.] This is a great investment and what a deal you get from purchasing on Amazon. I see the T3 dryers on sale at TJ Maxx periodically but it is still no way near the deal I got on Amazon. Right away I bought one for my mother [per her request] and we can gladly say we have never looked back!|pos
This Conair 1875 watt turbo style dryer really does do a great job ob drying my hair. Very quick and efficient.|pos
this product is excellent, good quality, durable excellent presentation. I had no problems even with quality. thanks you for it|pos
I LOVEDD MY BLOWDRYER .I ALWAYS BEEN USEING TWINTURBO  BLOWDRYER BUT I LOVE HOW LIGHT THIS IS AND EVEN MORE POWERFUL.|pos
I love this hair dryer.  It has great power and capabilities.  Much better than anything I've found in drug stores.|pos
I was never a fan of blow dryers but this one was awesome.I didn't like the attachment that accompanied the blow dryer but overall it works and i like it.I recommend it.|pos
love this blow dryer had the red one before but the wiring was cut.. this one is stronger<br />works great... good price|pos
Very easy to mount. Even easier to use. The unit automatically shuts off when returned to the cradle. No need to spend money on higher priced units. Very nice product|pos
Do not buy. It was great while it lasted, but it shorted out after 3 months of use.<br />Quiet and Seemed to be quality...until its very early smoking, stinking death.<br /><br />Find another that lasts longer.|neg
works wonderful. gets hot and drys very fast. shipped fast, Would buy another one if I had to. If you need heat to your hair you wont go wrong purchasing this item.|pos
Does everything the manufacturer states and the price was well worth it.  Shipping was quick and product was in good condition.  Would recommend this hair dryer.|pos
I have full size T3 for the home, and I wanted a compact T3 for travel (because no one wants to have a bad hair-day on vacation; think of the pictures!) I need a decent dryer to handle my long hair. Hotel dryers are always pretty cheap, and my old mini travel was useless. T3 travel dryer is pretty comparable to the full size. You still get fairly fast dry times, softer hair, no frizz, and more volume. The only difference between the Travel and Full size is that the Travel drying times are a bit longer. It also comes with a little travel pouch, as an added bonus.<br /><br />You can certainly get away with buying the travel dryer for home use to save money over the regular one (which normally runs $200, and you really have to wait out the sales). It works better than a typical semi-professional dryer in the same price range (works better than my old Tool Science dryer, which was about $60).<br /><br />My favorite thing about the T3s is that they can actually handle restyling my hair when it's already dry (none of my old dryers could ever do this; I had to spray water in my hair and re-dry).<br /><br />Another review mentioned the drier did not have a serial number on the nozzle. This was not my experience. My dryer had the sticker with the serial number under the nozzle (look for a clear label that says DANGER). I highly recommend registering your product on the T3 website. I had problem with my full size dryer (not this travel size one), and the T3 Co, honored their warranty and fixed it.|pos
I should start by stating my wife was the one that used this dryer so the report of how well it worked is indirect. We gave it 1 star because I couldn't give 0 stars. Don't get me wrong. The dryer worked great for 3 months. Then, the motor went out. The honeymoon was over. The box states it has a 24 month manufacturers warranty. They will replace, but it costs money. For me it was $40 plus another $15 to ship. Absurd! They said even doing so was against their rules because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. Well, long story short, the manufacturer (T3) wanted $55 to replace. Amazon, knowing this is a poor business practice, stood behind their service and refunded the entire purchase price. To summarize, I wouldn't buy anything this manufacturer peddles and I hope you don't either.|neg
Have used it 4 times. Powerful, easy to handle<br />and dries hair in half the time of my. Easy to hold handle design. Best of all, it is small and lightweight.<br />Highly recommend this dryer.|pos
I was in need of a new dryer and this was the only one I could buy right away that a comb would fit. I've only used it once but I can truly say its night and day from my Gold n Hot dryer of 7 years. My hair is thick and usually take at least 20 to 30 minutes with my old dryer. It only took my about 10 minutes to completely dry my hair. For me this is amazing because it cut down on my usual 1.5 process of doing my hair.  Oh and tried the oil and its just as great as the dryer leaving my hair feeling soft, shiny and healthy. The only downside was it was a bit heavy nothing one couldn't handle. Oh and the price as I usually wouldn't spend this much on a dryer but its worth as of now. I would recommend as at the moment. If anything changes I will update my review.|pos
This hairdryer is everything I need, great choice for me. Would reccomend to anyone that does not need a professional type hair dryer|pos
I purchased the t3 featherweight Luxe dryer from a retail store. It lasted about 9 months. I contacted the company but because I didnt register the product, I had to pay another $55 to ship it off. 6 weeks later, I received a newer t3 2i model, but it didnt include any of the extra accessories that my first one did, including the diffuser which I use everyday!! Called the company back...and instead of just sending me a diffuser, they tell me that I have to send the whole thing back and that they will ship out a new older model. In other words, another 6 weeks without a hair dryer to get the diffuser that I need. So...by the time I purchase a new diffuser for $30 and pay the $55 for a replacement, I could just have bought a brand new RELIABLE chi or something. Don't buy the t3. It's more trouble than its worth!!! You can get a cheap one and it will be of the same quality.|neg
But my first one was $300! I was thrilled to find one at this low price, and it has additional features! I love it because it works faster yet quieter than other blow-driers, is supposedly healthier for hair (mine is definitely less dry since using it!), and doesn't blow my hair all over at the high setting - it is very pleasant to use. Also my first one was a featherweight and I didn't notice that this one was not until it was already shipping. I decided to see if it was heavier, and it is not. So I am completely satisfied! I bring this with me to nice hotels because it's always better than whatever they provide.|pos
I've been using this exact same hair dryer for 20 years!  There's a reason I keep buying it even though it seems to die after 4-5 yrs of constant use.  The nightlight is perfect for the master bath.  Now we don't wake each other up in the middle of the night by turning on the normal light.|pos
Have had it for about 2 years. Works superbly: has lots of power; the handle still folds as when it was new; the retractable cable mechanism still works like it did when it was new; affordable price. All things considered it is a great product.|pos
My husband does a lot of traveling and had commented he liked the hair dryers that are in hotels that hang on the wall. I bought us one and am sure glad I did. It's nice just to reach up and have it there ready to use, instead of having it in a drawer or under the counter with the cord wrapped around it. Loved it so much bought our son and daughter one for there homes. They like theirs also.<br />Would highly recommend.|pos
The hairdryer works just as it was described.  It is small and compact, so it's much more easy to handle than drug store hairdryers.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone who has long, thick hair (I have long, very thick, dry and damaged hair).<br /><br />I would also like to say that I will be a faithful Amazon customer for any products I need and Amazon carries.  I was blow drying my hair when the hairdryer fell to the floor and broke.  I contacted Amazon and, without even questioning me about why the hairdryer broke, Amazon replaced it at no charge and it was delivered in two days!  I am extremely impressed with Amazon.  Thank you Amazon.  I really appreciate your customer service.|pos
I have been researching hair dryers and came upon this dryer which my mother owns (and I still borrow).  I'm looking to buy my own for convenience. My mother originally bought this dryer because it was used in a lot of Dominican salons and the fact that she's had it over 10 years I think speaks for itself. We didn't buy it on Amazon but, at a local beauty supply for about $60 then.  I wanted to leave a review because I felt that a lot of reviews I've seen for different dryers were left by people with hair types that could be dried well even without a hair dryer. Not so for me.<br /><br />My hair:<br />- Thick<br />- Coarse<br />- Long (past the middle of my back)<br />- Dominican (if that helps)<br />- Cannot air dry it (it would dry very puffy and frizzy if so)<br />- Has been relaxed (I relax it 2-4 times a year)<br />- Retains water (humid weather wreaks havoc)<br /><br />What seems to be most people's hair types in hair dryer reviews overall (not just this one):<br />- Able to dry with minimal effort (no brushing or able to point the dryer generally and have their hair still dry straight)<br />- Hair that can dry in 5-20 minutes with minimal effort<br />- Thick (though I think some people are confused as to their actual hair type)<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this hair dryer is only 1300 watts. After reading many dryer reviews, I thought I'd need something that was 2000 watts. Now, I'm rethinking that because this still does a good job at 1300. I think some people who leave dryer reviews don't know their actual hair type and/or how to properly blow dry their hair for a smooth, lasting, straight finish. Sometimes it's not the dryer's fault but, HOW people attempt to dry their hair. My mother does hair very well (if you've ever gone to a Dominican salon, you know that Dominican salons tend to do hair well). Some people at other salons tend to dry all hair types as if they are the same and dry the same and that isn't the case, leaving me (or others Iknow with similar hair) with terrible results. These have been my experiences and obviously don't apply to everyone. I don't like going to salons and haven't gone in years. Using this dryer, I have always received compliments on how nice and straight my hair looks.<br /><br />When I first tried to do my own hair (without really knowing how to) using someone's John Frieda 1875 watt hair dryer. I did a horrible job that took me a very long time and ended with puffy hair, not smooth at all but at least dry. If you don't use a blow dryer on a hot enough setting, it will not dry well, it only gets the water out of your hair is all. My mother, using the same dryer, did a much better job similar to the results with this dryer.  You have to use a brush of some type (round or straight) to pull and straighten the hair for a smooth finish.  You should also dry only small sections at a time for better results and always point the dryer down and in the direction of the hair shaft using the concentrator nozzle. I use a thermal protector as well as other products for shine so, I can't comment on the dryer's efficacy on those things.<br /><br />PROS about this dryer:<br />- Takes my hair only about 40 minutes to fully dry (after just squeezing out excess water with a towel, parting, clipping and drying small sections at a time. Compare this to salons where I have to sit under a hooded dryer for well over an hour and have them still blow dry my hair straight after, which takes another 20 minutes or so for a total of almost two hours.)<br />- Dries smoothly and straightens well (no need to use a flat iron after)<br />- Gets very hot<br />- Strong air flow<br />- Good weight (not too heavy)<br />- Buttons are well placed (don't accidentally press anything)<br />- Long cord length (Haven't measured it exactly but, it is at least 6 feet, probably more and has never been an issue)<br />- Removable filter (can easily clean for a longer life)<br />- Durable (has been owned for at least 10years and still works well, using it several times a week on 2-3 people with similar hair types to my own)<br />- Comes with a concentrator nozzle (Stays put and after years of accidental drops has never broken)<br />- Could go for up to a week without having to redo hair<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Brand name rubbed off after many years (I don't care but, may be a con for some)<br />- Gets very hot (have to protect my ears sometimes and cannot leave it close to my scalp for long. Good that it gets that hot but, you have to be careful so it's a pro and con)<br />- Loud (I think most dryers are. In terms of hearing conservation, I would recommend using ear plugs with dryers since they are so close to your head/ears and are very loud for a long period of time. This could eventually result in some amount of noise-induced hearing loss. Not specifically with just this dryer but, any dryer.)<br />- Only has a hot and cool setting (each with different strengths. The cool setting isn't that cool, it is warm although I've only used it after using hot for over 30 minutes. This is only a con if you're looking for a dryer with a cool shot.)<br />- Somewhat expensive (there are many dryers available for half this price so it is an investment)<br />- Not compact (If you're looking for something like that. I have had bad experiences with hotel dryers that leave my hair a big puffy mess so I will still pack and use this, even though it is a full size hair dryer. It's that good.)<br /><br />I would recommend this product but, I am not personally buying it for myself because it is over my budget. I am looking for a dryer that is less than $40-50 and available through prime. This dryer is not available with prime shipping and the beauty supply store has jacked up the price over the years. If you can afford to spend that amount on a dryer, it is a good investment. I'd prefer not to if I can find something that works as well as this one for less money. If I do find something like that, I will definitely share that (I'm researching and will try) but, at least I have this dryer as a backup if anything.|pos
That's what I needed! It's fixed on the wall and always ready to be used! Very convenient and efficient! Great!|pos
I received the hair dryer, installed in on the wall, and had used it less than two months when the blower went out. Due to a glitch in Amazon's computer system, I was unable to complete the return/replacement procedure, so I am stuck with a broken appliance. Won't buy this item again, and probably won't buy anything like this from Amazon again.|neg
It takes a long time to dry very long, thick hair like mine, so a dryer with a heavy duty AC motor is a must.  It might be a bit heavy, but it works well and should last a while.|pos
I love Remington products!  This hair dryer has performed perfectly for the $20 I got it for on Amazon.<br />I replaced my Conair Ion Shine after 7 years.  Regret not doing it sooner!<br />My hair was frizzing and I thought it was because of my age!  Nope - my Conair was shot!<br />So since the on/off switch broke on the Conair - I finally decided that was unsafe enough to warrant a new hair dryer.<br /> Plus I never like the switches on that dryer anyway.<br />I love this Tstudio hair dryer.  It is not too loud - which is great if you suffer from hearing or headache issues.<br />I love the color.  It is extremely attractive.  It is a dark chocolate brown with a pinky purple accent.  Goes nicely with my bathroom decor.  OH!  AND THE BEST PART!  It does not hurt my hands!  It is ergonomic!  I feels like a dream!  It is a perfect fit in my palm and I don't feel the switches are in the way at all.  I found that I naturally held the dryer so the thumb was grasping along the length of the switches which is perfect!  So excited about that part!<br />Was going to buy the BaBlyss (sp?) but when I checked that out on YouTube, I intensely disliked the noise of it.<br />So - Remington it is!  I hope that I get at least 3 or 4 years out of it and I will be an extremely happy customer.|pos
We use this multiple times a day and it is very convenient having it on the wall. Liked the idea after seeing it in hotel rooms.|pos
so glad I purchased this one, so many options out there, but I didn't want to spend a lot, so I choose this based off the reviews, so glad I did. it works great, is super fast compared to all other driers ive had, which is many, and I love the ion, I wont buy one without it, and can tell a difference with ion! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air, which is great, you don't have to change the switch to cool air, just hole in the blue button on any setting! GREAT! it gets hot, but not so hot that it burns your neck (or my daughters neck, which is always a problem with the girls, she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect), however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly, which is a great deal for her, since that was her other problem with them. and its great for me too, since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair, now I can fully dry it in that amount of time! it is easy to hold/handle, and has all the options that an expensive dryer would, with the add ons (2 different ones!), they clip on and off easy also! it is sturdy, I have had it for a couple months, and I am very rough with them, leave them in the bathroom, laying out, or tucked beside the makeup table, laying in floor, or just through under the cabnit,, and I have had no issues at all, it doesn't have a scratch on it! amazing! i would recommend this to everybody, my sis already got the same one, after using mine,since she loved it, and still does after a month, and now my mom has the same one as well, and we all bought them on here, to be sure it was the exact same one, since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same! so, yes, recommended, love it, love it , love it!|pos
Was exactly what I was needing. Girlfriend has now purchased 3 of these. The turbo option is great and we will continue to get the same model|pos
My girl ONLY wanted this hair dryer to replace the same one that just died.  Found it here on Amazon FAR cheaper than anywhere else and with Amazon Prime it was delivered to my doorstep in 2 days.  Great price and my girl loves it (she says it dries her thick hair fast and doesn't dry her hair out in the process), so that's it.  Highly recommend!|pos
I love this hair dryer!  I asked my hairdresser how he achieved such silkiness and shine in my hair, when I, using  the same products at home, couldn't.  He told me the blow dryer is the key.  He told me to buy from Amazon for best price, and to make sure I chose the Featherweight T3 by  Bespoke Labs.  It is delicate; I keep it in the box and put it away as soon as I'm done, which is 10-12 minutes.  If it is dropped, the tourmaline technology can be damaged and will not work.  It is definitely worth the extra care it requires; it dries my hair FAST and leaves it shiny, sealed and beautiful!|pos
Does not dry out my thick, coarse hair. Hair is softer, more manageable, and more conditioned compared to a standard hair dryer. Highly recommended!|pos
Living in the South, humidity takes it's toll on my hair so I was excited to visit Vegas where I'd heard there's &#34;no humidity.&#34; I planned to use the hotel's hair dryer (MGM) to lighten the packing. The hair dryers they equip the rooms with were amazing and I kept telling my husband how much I loved it and how quick it dried my hair!! (I wanted to take it home but he wouldn't let me! ha) He told me it was probably just the dry air there and didn't understand my excitement over this hair dryer. Long story short, I got on Amazon as soon as we got home and ordered it. I AM IN LOVE! This hair dryer cuts your drying time in half and leaves hair shiny and smooth (and trust me, I have frizzy, wavy hair!) I still use the flat iron of course to finish off the job but this hair dryer has been a life saver!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!|pos
Well, I had a Turbo 1500 for a long time until it died. Then I made my research and found this new and powerful version of Twin Turbo 3500. So, I wanted ti invest in something good. I do my own hair at home, and my hair is curly. I finished to dry my hair so fast. I just  love this Twin Turbo 3500 and it worth the $$$.|pos
I have thin hair and this dryer did an awesome job w giving me lots of volumn. I'm happy to have given it a try. Keeper.|pos
enjoyed this dryer for many cruises and wanted my own, Have not been disappointed!!  Powerful and tiny, delivers as promised|pos
This is the second of this product that I have owned.  The first lasted over six years but unfortunately quit working so I ordered another just like it.  Works great.  I don't have to go hunting for the hair dryer and plugging it in and putting it away every day.  I highly recommend it.|pos
I looked everywhere for a dryer to meet my needs. This one is just exactily what I needed and wanted.|pos
My wife is happy with it, that's all I needed! Seems to work fine, and I noticed it's not as loud and annoying as some other one's my wife had before!|pos
Bought this for my mother.  Bonnet was very cheaply made and hard to connect.  Wouldn't recommend for anyone. Finally had to buy a hard bonnet type.|neg
This is the seocnd one of these I have owned and the first lasted over 10 years.  Gret product, glad I could find it again on Amazon.<br />The mutipe temperature settings make it a dream to have.  LOVE IT!!!|pos
This hair dyer works great and I have seen it for more money at local stores. I highly recommend it!|pos
I thought this dryer would be perfect; compact, not clunky, and easy to travel with. That's really the only thing this dryer is good for, to travel with. All the main functions, useless.When I had the bonnet on, dare I move an inch and that hose would fly right off! AND the highest heat settings was not hot at all. I painfully sat there with the bonnet on and putting the hose back on about a million times, to only come out with 30% dry hair after 30 minutes worth of sitting. This product was cheaply made and without any thought put into it. I will be returning..|neg
One of those...saw one just like it in a motel while on vaca with my GF a few years back...I thought more of it than she did (primarily because the more things kept off her bathroom counter, the better).<br />That's what she thought, too (that I bought this as a 'message')...which is why she's used it maybe three times in four years since I installed it there for her.<br />It's a great hair dryer (I let mine air-dry--my hair looks more like Michael Bolton's--or Fabio's--that way).<br />This little dryer still works great (I guess, I turn it on every once in awhile to check).<br />Yay, relationship issues!|pos
I purchased thi dryer from Amazon based on reviews.  My wife loves it.  It is light and powerful.  A real professional hair dryer.  Subsequently I purchased on for my daughter, who also said she has never had one even close to this.  She said iit makes her hair as when she goes to the beauty parlor.  I plan to purchase one for my other two daughters.  A superior product.|pos
Quality: This is the best hair dryer I have used. Hands down. My favorite feature is that it doesn't produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you'll really appreciate the low noise it makes. The performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable. I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym. My wife and I share it and she's as satisfied with the quality as I am.<br /><br />Price: For the price, you can't beat this dryer. I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product. The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.<br /><br />Shipping: I came back from a two-day business trip and it was waiting for me, even though I didn't expect it for a week or so. Of course the wife got to it first :)<br /><br />Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed. I couldn't ask for better customer service.<br /><br />Overall: Highly recommended, both dyer and seller. Thank you!|pos
This was a great purchase. The unit is relatively quiet, simple and works better than expected. It is so convenient to use every day. The night light is a small but appreciated bonus!|pos
I have very dry hair and this little hairdryer works so quickly, I can already see an improvement.  My hair is less frizzy and much softer and shinier.|pos
Yes, I love it.  It is so easy to use and the force of the hot air dries my hair very fast.|pos
Lots of blow, lots of heat, and it is a light weight!  I have a bad shoulder and this thing is easy to use.  We even bought a second one.|pos
Best hair dryer, definitely worth the money! Gets super hot, fast, making it so much easier to blow dry my hair since usually itll take an hour to dry but only takes about 15 minutes with this one!|pos
I recently upgraded my old dryer of 8 years.<br />1. This was slightly heavier than I expected, only because my old one was super light weight. However, the weight is not noticeable other than that. The material of the dryer is pleasant to hold.<br />2. Cute design with two optional add ons is a plus.<br />3. Dries quickly! I can fully dry my thick shoulder length hair in 3-4 minutes.<br />4. Much quieter than my old dryer.<br />5. The only con, is that the buttons sometimes can be pushed when drying the hair because of the way they are positioned on the handle. So, if you do not have a mindful touch while blow drying, you may accidentally switch from high output to low output.|pos
I have thick and very long hair, and I have used so many different hair dryers in my life. But, none of the past hair dryers compare to this wonderful and efficient hair dryer. Now, I can blow dry my hair in half the time than before I had this hair dryer. I hope this hair dryer is never discontinued!|pos
This product is very very good. I purchased it after seeing my roommates use this one. It is completely worth the money and it gives a nice blow dry leaving your hair feel awesome.|pos
We are very picky about hair dryers and this is the best hair dryer we have ever had. It has a long cord and lots of settings that actually differ which makes it easy to dry hair for kids as well as adults. I have recommended this hair dryer to friends.|pos
Wife wanted a professional quality hair dryer.  Has been using for over 2 years and still going strong.  Well worth the money.|pos
I wish I saved the box for this dryer so I can return this dryer. It is so heavy and very difficult to hold when trying to dry my hair.  Also I don't think it has the ionic drying it claims to have.|neg
LOVE IT, this is my third one.  great speed light weight.  only wish they lasted longer.  but for the price you can't go wrong|pos
I recomend this Hair Dryer, It's small and works well, the Heat settings work well for fast Drying and Styling.  It's small enough to go with you on Trips, Or use at the house without taking up much Room.  Get one !|pos
I chose this dryer based on product description and customer reviews.  It performs well and is lightweight.  I highly recommend!|pos
go o oo oo oo oo ooo o ooooo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo  oo oooo ooooo ooooooooooo oooooood|pos
Compact size perfect for traveling and powerful enough to do its job. I am very pleased with it and the price is very reasonable.|pos
I purchased this mini hairdryer because I travel a lot, and because I have a small bathroom and I don't like taking up a lot of precious counter space. Plus, is it just me, or have regular-sized hair dryers doubled in size over the past few years? They're huge and over-sized, in my opinion. I saw that this came with a travel bag (zebra-striped) as well as a diffuser and concentrator attachment. For the price (around $15), I thought this was a great deal. I was expecting to be let down by this little hair dryer, but I was pleasantly surprised with it! It works great, and I haven't had any problems with it. The only thing that would make this better would be if they could include a 'cool' setting, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.<br /><br />If you travel a lot or if you just don't want a huge hairdryer, this is a great hairdryer.|pos
Very good. We recommend it for multiples use for home and traveling when the the hotels do not have dryer.|pos
A great little travel hair dryer, very light yet powerful. Works even better than my full sized one. I use it at home too.|pos
I've been through three hair dryers in the past year. One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??), the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...) And then there was the Onei.<br /><br />The Onei is just perfect! I really like that is has an ion activation switch in the handle. When you turn on the dryer, you can hear it speed and warm up - there isn't that sudden blast of metal smelling heat like the cheaper dryers I've owned. I definitely recommend the Onei to anyone who wants a quality dryer.|pos
I'm a hairstylist. This dryer fit me like a glove. LOVE it. Concentrator attachment is nice and wide, and the dryer is really quiet, not heavy at ALL. Highly recommend.|pos
I really can't rate this one, because it was a x-mas gift, but my sister asked for it and she had had one just like it and she asked for another one, so I guess she loves it.|pos
excelente todo me llego en tiempo y condiciones esperadas extraordinario servicio sigan asi honestidad, responsabilidad y buen servicio lo mejor de lo mejor|pos
This dryer is very nice, and my wife is completely satisfied.  On the other hand, I liked the older one better because it was more forceful and the cord was longer.  We didn't have to dim the light on the old one, but this one is very bright and I had to tape something over it to tone it down.  I used a piece of thick paper that I cut to exactly cover the light and it is OK now.<br />It's a very nice product and I think that we would order it again.|pos
Love it. The controls are easy to use but do not get in your way.  It runs much quieter than other hair dryers I've used.|pos
I bought this because it was cheap and I needed a hair dryer. It works really well and I will probably buy a 'back up' since I expect it will go 'belly up' before too long. It it only last another 6 months, I'll consider it money very well spent.|pos
My hair dresser recommended this dryer.  She saId it would reduce frizzies.  It has and I am pleased.  I like the way it folds up for traveling.  I will get great use of it.|pos
I have a coworker who whenever she comes in with blown straight hair, it looks like she got it professionally done. I was looking to upgrade my blow dryer, and this was her recommendation.<br /><br />At first I was skeptical because it's kind of expensive, but then I bit the bullet and got it. I LOVE it.<br /><br />I have very curly, fine hair, and a lot of it, prone to frizz. It used to take me close to an hour and a half to blow dry my hair, then smooth over it with a flat iron.<br /><br />This blower dryer cuts my total hair-doing time in half! And I just touch up with a straightener on low heat (around my face, the top/back of my head). I use one of the concentrator attachments that comes with it (I believe the middle one).<br /><br />Also, I didn't touch up with a straightener for a few days, and my blow out really lasted!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone with hard-to-manage hair who wants a sleek and bouncy blow out.|pos
bought this for my mom after i used her old one and decided it sucked big time. she said she likes it and uses it everyday. i have yet to use it but she was happy!|pos
Great product, have had it for about a month now.  Seems well-made, love the soft coating, plenty of power, cool-touch button works well.  Only one slight negative... the placement of the temp. switch is right where my fingers fall on the handle and I always turn it to medium instead of hot heat, but a minor consideration overall. Got this with an on-line coupon which made it an even better value!|pos
I love it.  Works very well and plenty of air velocity to dry anyones hair.  Highly recomended for anyone whio needs a good hair dryer.|pos
It's noisy.  I knew when I bought it that it wasn't silent.<br /><br />It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I'm not putting air where I don't want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a cool button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for turbo on and turbo off - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.<br /><br />Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of catch in two places, so it won't close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it's impossible to hurt your hand. I use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles.  Works really well :)|pos
Works good aa bb cc dd ee ff gg hh ii jj kk ll mm nn oo pp qq rr|pos
I bought one of these for traveling and my stepmom was visiting and she used it and loved it so much she wanted one for herself so I ordered her one as well! She  loves the power and it's lightweight.|pos
It's been almost a year since I purchased this hair dryer and I love it.  I love the retractable cord and the different heat settings, as opposed to just having low and high options.  Works great!|pos
Compact and light, but powerful for a travel hair dryer. We unplugged the hotel dryer and used this one because it worked better|pos
I liked the dryer...while it worked. Out of nowhere, it would not blow hot air if it is on high. Customer service told me i have to mail it back to them and pay for shipping - the new one cost less than the shipping costs! That is if I wanted to waste more of my money and get another cheap dryer that would not last even a year! So dissapointing|neg
I like this hair dryer. I just needed one quickly so I didn't really check it out. I just grabbed it and ran. It dries very well without burning your head off and that is an important thing. I don't want my hair burnt but I don't want to take a long time either. This one does both those things. I highly recommend it. I think you'll like it too.|pos
Es un regalo para mi gorda bella la mas bella que Dios me ha regalado en esta vida la amo|pos
El articulo llego en perfecto estado y exactamente como lo describió el vendedor.<br />Cumplieron con hacer el envio rapido y seguro.<br /><br />LOS CALIFICO EXCELENTE|pos
Oh the power.  Oh the fast dry.  Oh the beauty of my hair when it is dry after 5 minutes!!!  I have extremely thick hair, and it typically takes 12-15 minutes to dry completely using a hair dryer.  My hair was dry and NOT frizzy after 5 minutes!  WHAT??!!  This dryer is very powerful, and high heat setting is enough to dry the hair but not make it smoking hot.  There is a reason this is rated as Amazon's #1 best selling hair dryer.|pos
I've tried the more expensive ones out there, including the Gold n' Hot (on  wheels & the bonnet dryer).  My hair never got dry in the back and in the crown area when using the Gold n' Hot dryers.  For years I used the Conair HH320LB Pro Styler Bonnet Dryer, and my hair dried very quickly.  When mine finally conked out after about 10 years of use, I went to Walmart to purchase a new one; and to my surprise, they no longer carried them.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply, Target, and other Beauty Supply Stores...no success.  Finally, I thought &#34;Amazon--bet I can find it there.&#34;  Sure enough, there it was!  I ordered it immediately!  I love the fact that this dryer has the option to open and close the vent on the top of the hood which is where other dryers lack.  I keep the vent closed for fast drying.  I am a licensed Cosmetologist who uses the commercial/industrial dryers at that salon, but at home, I use my Conair...works just as good!  Thanks Conair and Amazon!  Never stop making this product!...|pos
I've always wanted a small hair dryer for traveling.  I actually use this everyday. Great buy and I would purchase again.|pos
I love this hair dryer. I bought it as a replacement after my second Revlon dryer bit the dust. I use it on the Low/Warm setting and it's just perfect for my hair type (thin/damaged hair), not too hot, but not too cold. Dries my hair super fast too, literally under 5 minutes and done. My other 2 hair dryers hardly put out any heat on the medium settings and took forever to dry my hair. Very happy with this since again, my hair is already damaged from heat.<br />I really love the comb attachment it came with too. I've never seen anything like this before. After your hair is dry/almost dry, if you put the dryer on the low/hot with the attachment on, it really helps with straightening your hair and pretty much eliminates the need for a flat iron, another huge plus. It comes with a concentrator attachment too, but I don't use that.<br />The dryer is very lightweight, quiet,  the cord is short so you're not tripping all over it, but there's still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall.<br />This is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price.|pos
Didn't last 5 months. Cheaply made and the motor burned up in no time at all. Don't waste your money.|neg
Exactly as described - so small!  When it arrived, I thought it looked like a toy, but this little dryer works!  Just used it traveling and it absolutely beats the standard hairdryers found in hotel rooms.  Doesn't weigh a thing, takes up no space and works just as well as full size dryers.  Great decision!|pos
I have long dark hair that is prone to grease, this dryer makes my hair manageable and makes it feel clean. I love it|pos
I am very happy with my new hair dryer. It drys my hair faster and does not heat it up so that it looks frizzy. I recommend this dryer. It is heavy but that is not a problem and the buttons are fine right where they are.|pos
I researched several ionic ceramic hair dryers and ended up with this one and I am in love. I'm glad I didn't spend more because this one gets the job done and you can keep some cash in your pocket. I have thick hair and if I were to let it air dry, it would have this ugly frizzy wave to it. I love that this hair dryer came with a concentrator and diffuser. I use the hair dryer by itself first and just finger through my hair with the setting on high speed and high heat to just get the excess water out and then throw on the concentrator and low dry with my ionic brush. I'm literally amazed at how fast I can dry my hair with this thing and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner.|pos
It's a great simple hair dryer, works fine. 2 speeds, cooling blow button, that's it. Can't complain for the price. It's strong and light weight, easy to use. I don't need fancy $$ dryer.|pos
This was my first Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer. I was looking for a hair dryer that would cut my drying time because I have thick hair. What a surprise, it did just that! It cut my drying time to a third of what it used to take with my old hair dryer. It proved to be as advertised. It made my hair smoother, shinier and less frizzy too!|pos
We tried other brands after the first T3 died, but they never matched how well the T3 performed. My wife explicitly asked for another T3, got it, and she loves it.|pos
Terrific dryer with all the attachments and features one would ever need. Can be used by a professional, has it all. Does not disappoint!|pos
This dryer if fantastic!  It works very well with my hair style and even if I used rollers it would comply.  Set-up is very easy.  There is great heat control from the top of the hood as well as the knob.  Easy to open and close|pos
does it comes with the front piece? I want to make sure before i purchase this dryer. It had happend before to me|pos
I've only had this blow dryer for 3 or 4 days, but I already love it. The older one I was using was more than 20 years old and the difference is amazing. I have no idea if the tourmaline or any of the rest of it mean anything, but the difference between this dryer and my old one was great. My old dryer would almost burn my scalp and had only two settings high/hot and low/low. After drying my hair with this new dryer, my hair was silky and soft and, yes, no frizz. It also dried my hair very fast. I used the high speed with medium heat and it was perfect for the drying, then I turned it down to low heat and speed for styling.<br /><br />This dryer has separate buttons for heat and speed. I spent a lot of time staring at the picture that was on this page and could not tell if there were two buttons or just one, so I wanted to mention that, and I uploaded some pictures of the buttons as well. The buttons are next to each other on the handle, on the inside where your fingers grip. The sliding buttons are not easily moved, so it's not likely that you would slide them unintentionally while drying your hair.<br /><br />I ordered and received this blow dryer from Amazon.com, but the dryer they sent me was slightly different from the one pictured here. It looks almost exactly like this one, but the silver design on the side is smooth and it says you on it instead of infiniti and doesn't say Conair underneath, though it does say Conair on the nozzle part of the dryer. Other than that, the dryer they sent me is the same as this one: same specs, same buttons, same cord, so perhaps it's just a newer version of this dryer and the photo is outdated. The dryer I received also looks darker than the one in the picture, but it's a sparkly dark teal that looks very pretty.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it. Before purchasing, I saw the reviews of some that said it didn't last long, but I decided to order it anyway, since I didn't find another I liked better than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update. This blow dryer is still great. I love it. My hair has never looked better after blow dryer. I still have the same little quibble that I had before, though: the little tie that is attached to the cord is just much too short. It makes folding up the cord a pain. I have to put my glasses on and struggle with it for several minutes. I have a hand mixer with the exact same type of tie on it. It's just a little longer than this one and it's so easy to attach it. If they'd made this one even a half inch longer, it would have been so easy to use. I will probably try to find some alternative to keep the cord folded up, but they really should have just put one on that was long enough.<br /><br />Even so, the blow dryer is great. I love having different speeds and heat levels. Also, the hottest setting doesn't burn my scalp.etter than this one. Only time will tell how long it will last, but for now, I'm very pleased.<br /><br />04/10/2013 UPDATE: I wrote this review when I'd only had the blow dryer for a few days, so I wanted to do a quick update.

What can I say? I didn't buy this for me bought it for the wife.  I haven't used a hair dryer since 1989.  She loves this one.|pos
I discovered this hair dryer at a hotel I was staying in and loved it. After I got home, I went on line and found it at<br />Amazon for a really good price. It is small enough to pack in a suitcase without taking up much room. but heavy duty<br />enough to handle my thick hair. I love it.|pos
Simple, just enough power, and all those ions are exactly what I was looking for.  The color is a plus.|pos
I ordered this off Amazon as it was half the price of Target.  I was worried that it wouldn't be powerful enough or hot enough as I have long (middle of my back) thick hair.  It works just like a bigger dryer and is the size of my hand.  I travel all summer and never take a blow dryer with me because they take up too much room.  Got this dryer and Remington Travel curlers...its all good.  Both are great for traveling and work better than I expected.|pos
I have had this for over a year and it still works great<br />the cold button works fast<br />the cleaning sheild is a great feature to remove lint|pos
I am so happy with this purchase!! It works absolutely great.  I have very thick hair with natural curls.  Normally it takes me about 20 to 30 minutes to blow dry my hair and then I have to go over it with the flat iron to get it completely straight.  It took me ten minutes tops when using this blow dryer and it was perfect when I was done.  Not only was it straight but I was able to style it as well.  I have to say I'm shocked!!! and happy!! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who blow dries there hair straight.|pos
This dryer is compact, has a powerful fan and blows a lot of heat. My wife loves it. Not really quiet - like most dryers.|pos
Really good hairdryer. Purchased this one after our other Conair (who's still going strong!) was just getting too old. Speeds are nice and it doesn't burn you like our other one did. Also surprisingly very light!|pos
Despite the fact that it doesn't have any air temperature settings (air temp and strength are all combined I think, as low, medium and high), I greatly prefer this hair dryer over my old traditional style one. The comb attachments are AWESOME, and I feel like my hair dries much quicker and straighter now that I use them. The way the dryer vertically spreads the air throughout your hair leads to quicker and more even blow drying times and styles as well.<br /><br />I haven't used the brush attachement with the blowdryer but actually sometimes use it to just brush my hair when it's wet haha- works like a charm!|pos
I bought it for traveling but I use it all the time because it's powerful and lightweight. Definitely recommend the hair dryer and the seller.|pos
I have no regrets about purchasing this hair drier. It does not frizz my hair at all and is easy and quick to use :)|pos
I love the hot and cool settings. Does a great job overall, and I'm excited to try the diffuser it comes with|pos
I used the one much more expensive than this before but it broke and I bought this. It works really well so far and its Ionic function makes my hair smooth and soft. I'm very satisfied with it.|pos
This dryer is compact and easily portable.  It does an excellent job of drying hair over event the largest curlers.|pos
This is one of my wife's favorite presents.  It puts out a forceful flow of air, dries her shoulder length hair quickly and fits snugly in her gym bag|pos
I already have one like this, but I bought this one for my mother, and it's working better than mine. Thank you!|pos
I purchased this hair dryer because I liked the design.  Sliding buttons on the handle with separate controls for temperature and wind speed are good features.  I saw there were mixed reviews, but assumed Revlon had made the product well.  After two months of 10 to 15 minutes of use a day with the included diffuser, it spit blue fire and turned itself off.  I'm thankful for the safety feature, but have returned the item for a full refund.  I'm not willing to risk catching my hair on fire.|neg
A great hairdryer at a great price. It's very quiet and powerful. Arrived very fast and I would recommend this product|pos
Met all my expectations--small, compact, plenty of air, heat etc.  Good for travel since handle retracts and is lightweight for travel.|pos
great  I used this at a Marriott on visits and realized that my hair really looked better than at home.  I bought one for myself and now my hair looks good all of the time.  thanks.|pos
This is the best hair dryer ever,fast drying and easy to hold and use.  Our family has used them for<br />a number of years|pos
I love this dryer. I was first introduced to it when we stayed at a very upscale hotel. I wrote down the information and ordered on on Amazon when I returned home. It was a little pricey but some things are just worth it. The only down side for me is the placement of the buttons. I am right handed, andthe way I hold this dryer, allows me to  I sometimes accidently hit the off button as I am drying my hair. It is not a deal breaker, but a bit annoying. Nice wattage and fast drying. I would purchase it again, although maybe their newer models have the button relocated. Price of the item was reasonable as was the shipping cost. I would recommend the product and the seller.|pos
This hair dryer is perfect for long hair.  It is easy to use.  I am very thankful I got it.|pos
This hair dryer is amazing! It's light weight makes it easier to use. It dryers your hair super fast! I would definitely recommend it.|pos
I love the different settings and the drying capability.  I dries very quickly and is great a creating volume.  It is a little heavy, but worth the weight.|pos
We have had this for long long time, my wife uses this almost everyday and still works very good, she dropped the other day, and still works very good.|pos
Since I use this every day, it needs to be a good, reliable product. And that's exactly what it is.|pos
It looks like it would be too small to be effective, but not so. This little gadget really blows, and in a good way. The dual-voltage aspect makes it good for international travel. Get one. You won't be disappointed.|pos
I liked this hair dryer so much that when my old one finally died I bought another one. Some hair dryers are so loud they sound like a fighter jet taking off. This one is much quieter and is also quite light and easy to maneuver. You can't beat this for the price.|pos
I use this to melt beeswax to help preserve leather.  It works perfectly.  It was cheap and it does what I needed it to do.|pos
I like this item very much, easy to take and easy to control, that's exactly what I want to use in my daily life|pos
This is probably the best hair dryer I've ever had.  I have really thick, corse hair and haven't generally dried it much in the past because it would take so long.  Then once it was dry I'd have to straighten it because it would be all frizzy.  Not anymore!!!  This thing dries my hair quickly and also leaves it very smooth.  I LOVE it!  Now I dry my hair almost daily since it doesn't take me an hour from start to finish!|pos
Owned it less than a year, it broke! For no reason! Try to press reset button, still nothing, it is very disappointed!|neg
I blow-dry my hair almost everyday-and it used to be a chore. This hair dryer has made the process time go by SO quickly, leaves my hair smooth, AND is affordable.  If you're thinking of investing in an amazing hair dryer, invest in this one. It's half the price and totally worth it.|pos
Good hair dryer for the money, seriously. I've had one just like it for almost 8 years, love it. So this one for less than $10 is awesome!|pos
I purchased this and received it two days later! As always Amazon.com shipping is superior! Ive never had issues with an items sold from amazon.com although I have with their third party sellers. I thought this was a safe bet. I attempted to use it for the first time today and it caught on fire!!! I was using it in a bedroom in a safe outlet that I use for chargers and other items with no issue! It was not around any water! My hair was dry and was using it to help make it straighter. At first it had a smokey smell and I thought maybe this is like a new hair dryer smell. My straightener sometimes smells like this if I use with my hair wet so I thought this was fine. I turned it out waited 5 mins then tried again and luckily I cautiously turned the hair dryer away from hair to make sure it was safe and sure enough fire came out I turned it off unplugged it and it patted it down with a blanket till I stopped. I was sooo scared! luckily I wasn't burned but my blanket had to be tossed! Amazon.com was helpful with processing a return and I still think revlon products are great but something must have been wrong with this particular one so be careful with this!|neg
have everything i want,  go ooo oo o o o o o o o o o o oo o o d|pos
This is the best darn hair dryer. My daugthter asked for her own dryer so I didn't want spend a lot of money on her first dryer. This works way better than mine and I spent 3 times more on mine. It dry's faster and isn't as loud as mine. It's smaller and lighter. I think I might just have to get me one of these also.|pos
I bought this hairdryer because I stayed at a Marriott (Hilton?) in Providence, Rhode Island, and this was the hair dryer that the room was supplied with. I didn't think anything special of it when I first walked in, or when I brushed my teeth. I didn't realize what a competent little hair dryer this thing was until the next morning. When my hair was wet. And I need to dry my hair.<br /><br />The Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle seriously blows. I mean that. It puts out an impressive amount of heated air. The settings are appropriate - low, medium, high; they all provide about the amount of air you'd expect. The heat is nice. Nothing special there, but it dries hair.<br /><br />I don't think I've ever owned a hair dryer I've liked more. Granted, this is only my third one ever, but still, not too shabby.|pos
just okay aaa a  a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a just wanna finished this|pos
Awesome dryer! Handles well, dries the hair fast, very easy to control. The only negative...its a little heavy. Love it and would recommend it to all!|pos
This hair drier is superb! it is small and powerful. It is great for home or travel. Best one I ever owned.|pos
The clip on our old one finally broke after years of usage.  The girls liked it so much I bought another one - definitely a good value.  Keeps the dryer handy but out of the way.  And as a bonus they hadn't changed the mounting system so I just pulled the old one off the wall, adjusted the cord length and snapped the now one in.|pos
This is the way to get a professional quality hair dryer at a fraction of the cost.  There are three or four brands selling essentially the same dryer including this one but none have the cord length of this one.<br /><br />Its performance is exactly as hoped and more.<br /><br />The cord is incredibly long, making plug concerns a thing of the past.<br /><br />We bought our second one recently.|pos
The unit quit working on the lower setting, and it blows more than it heats and dries.  It has basically quit working. My husband has resumed using our ancient one, which we can no longer hang up (which was my impetus for purchasing a new one).  They just don't make things like they used to.  We just threw it away.|neg
I've always used KURUKURU and I'm glad I got it on Amazon because it works great for me right now. I don't know what I'd do without it!|pos
I bought this because I just moved and have been using my sister's hair dryer up to this point. I couldn't afford to spend a lot of extra money and I am already purchasing a million things for my new apartment, but being a female with thick, long hair and bangs, I *needed* a hair dryer. I was skeptical to purchase something so cheap, but really: WOW. This is perfect for me. It blows strongly on high, the heat is quite warm, and the cold setting is fantastic.<br /><br />I bought this for $8 and am SO happy about it. Don't waste your money on a more expensive one. I really don't see the point.|pos
If you really want to dry your hair quickly then this is the dryer you're looking for. It gets very hot and I LOVE IT! It is good for my hair (I have very thick curly and frizzy).|pos
I love anything that can put away the cord in a snap and dries my hair half the time as my other regular hair dryer - they are right, ionic technology does work!  I have no regrets buying this item.  It works as advertised!|pos
I love the cooling blow drying feature. I don't have to spend hours to get my hair dry. A great buy!|pos
I'm a professional hairdresser so I need a powerful blow dryer that's light. This serves the purpose it's powerful, light and hat. Six of the seven stylists in our salon use it do I guess there's nothing else to say.|pos
Like many, this was purchased because of the experience I have had with Andis clippers.  They have lasted 7 years plus.  This was great, at first.  After a few months use the power started gradually getting lower and lower.  Now it barely produces enough air to blow a tissue.  It is less than a year old so I contacted Andis about sending it in for repair.  I have yet to hear back.  Their website points you to the repair facilities in your area.  One problem, they only service Andis clipper products.  It makes me doubt whether Andis even makes these or just slaps their name on it.  If I don't get a response from Andis, I will take this apart and see if there is another manufacturers name inside.<br /><br />Update-Still no response, so I called again.  I was told they do not service hair dryers, they simply replace them.  So I am returning it, at my cost, for a replacement.<br /><br />New Update-Received my NEW replacement.  FYI, use a flat rate USPS bubble envelope and shipping will only cost $5.|neg
The Ritz Carlton hotel provides these hair dryers. After staying at one of their hotels I loved the hair dryer so much I bought one.|pos
This is great for me because i needed a new dependable hair dryer. Conair products are always a great to use|pos
this was a great christmas present. the haet adjustment and cord extension were great, the gfci was a good addition and the color was cool.|pos
Good quality and not expensive price. I would like to recommend you to buy it. A pleasant shopping experience. :)|pos
I ordered this hair dryer when my hair dryer stopped working. I received it in just a couple of days. What I love about this dryer is that it is dries and allows me to style my hair so much quicker than my old dryer. And the price is reasonable.|pos
This small dryer really does its job.  I relied on other's reviews which were extremely helpful.  The most expensive product is not necessarily the best product, and this one proves it.  Great value.|pos
Great dryer. Nice and light weight so my arms don't get worn out drying my long hair. Great power too.|pos
I was a hair cutter for ten years back in the 80's.  Nothing has ever beaten the Yellowbird as far as power and design.|pos
I use warm setting to dry and style and the cold setting to set. The product works great for my needs. I plan on using this for trips and a back up at home in case my other hair dryer quits working.|pos
The description states there is a cool shot button, but there is NO COOL SHOT BUTTON! Amazon, PLEASE correct this misleading description. I wanted a small, no-heat air blower for medical purposes. This dryer seemed to be the closest thing. I'm returning it, but what a waste of time!|neg
Replaced an old model with this.  It is faster, quieter, and lighter than it's predacessor.  Price the same as in stores,|pos
nice size, color and not heavy weight. It works very well and three options for blow air are very comfy. It doesnt take too much time to dry my hair. Folding handle and retractable wire are really useful . Very happy with that.|pos
I was looking for a dryer with no heat option... Those that I have found before have the button that you have to press down in order to get the cool hair...This one is different you can totally dry your hair without using any heat at all because  you can just press cool air button and unless you change it you only use the ambiant air like a very powerful ventilator...|pos
I stayed at a hotel in Chicago that used these in their room, and was so amazed by how much power comes out of this tiny little unit that I googled how much they cost, to learn that they are only around $25!  Now it's my go to travel dryer, and everybody is always so impressed with it.  I will be buying more, and I hope they never stop making these things!|pos
Great bang for the buck!  My hair has never been happier.  I wish all purchases were so easy and I wholeheartedley recommend this product.|pos
She is a lover of all things Hello Kitty and this hair dryer just happens to be a really good one.  Light weight and she still has her style and fun.|pos
sorry I don't have anymore to say about it. It does what it's supposed to do. Okay? If you want reviews you're going to have to stop limiting the numbers of words.|pos
I had this particular hairdryer before and it had gotten broke. I looked everywhere to replace it. I love the wall mount feature, it doesnt take up space. Its compact and has great power. I would recommend it to everyone.|pos
dries fast, quiet, sleek. bought for my dad for christmas to replace an old remington he had that also had the dual motor. works very quickly and it very nice looking. lasts a long time too. my dad had his old remington for 6 years! lol it was time for an upgrade. im sure hell have this another 6... ha|pos
This is compact and puts out more air than my full sized blow dryer.  I bought it because of it's dual voltage settings because I work internationally and will be traveling to Ireland soon.  I have been using it every day since I got it because I like it so much.|pos
Dries hair in no time at all!  Great price great product.  Lightweight and fairly quiet.  I am hoping that this drier lasts many years, as did my last Conair dryer.|pos
Purchased this because my daughter hated the loud hair dryer we had. This one is quite a bit quieter and well made.|pos
pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again. pretty good product, low noise, will buy again|pos
I plugged it in Turkey and it blew out right away, so I didn't have a hair dryer during my stay there. I am giving it 1 star, since I can't seem to be able to choose 0. The only purpose I bought this dryer for, was to use it in Europe.|neg
The hairdryer had made a strong electric shoot the moment i turned it on, plus i was using it in low tepmreture and it melted the front cover and it was very hot, wont recomend it.|neg
This is an amazing product. It leaves both hands free to do your hear. I have my on my mirror and it has not fallen off in the 2 months I have had this product. I am very pleased. This is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms.|pos
I love this product. This is truly an excellent thing to have for anyone who blow dries their hair.  I hate holding my arms above my head for prolonged periods and found this by searching for a product to hold my hair dryer. My one complaint is that the lever that snaps closed when you attach the suction cup...it snapped in half on the second time of use. It seems the shape of the lever makes it weak in the middle - poor design on that part of it. I am still able to attach it however by using a washcloth to hold the jagged edge when clamping the lever down. Other than that, the product is nice looking and functionally excellent.|pos
I'm pretty lazy. I will avoid excess walking at most costs. My ass can prove it.<br />So, we needed a new hair dryer for the changing table (we dry off our baby after we use wet wipes on her butt, and after she gets a bath), and we had to have one that was fast and could have a &#34;just warm&#34; setting. This one is so good that I find myself walking from one end of the house to the other in the morning to dry my own hair at the changing table. Without a mirror, no less. It's that good. So I just need to get a second one now because I can't keep this extra activity up.<br />Oh, and it's loud (I don't know how they'd make one that isn't), but I love the 4 settings (cool slow, warm fast, hot slow, and hotter fast) and it dries my hair in half the time as my old crappy one does. Even though it has the same wattage.<br />I also like the fact that it's white. Even if the cord isn't (that's actually annoying to someone like me who bought a white hair dryer because there are only bright colors in the nursery.... and now I have an unsightly black cord sticking out like a sore thumb). I guess you can't have it all.|pos
Doesn't blow enough air, I need to buy a better one. Great size and I did not have to wait too long to get it.|neg
This hair dryer is great--it's lightweight and dries my hair in half the time of all other hair dryers I've used.|pos
Thanks successfully received good product, I hope very soon make a new purchase with you. ...... .... .... .. .|pos
I've finally decided to replace this dryer.  For the past few months I've been making do with it because I don't have the receipt to return it.  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  I will say again  -  This dryer hood does not click into place and is not height adjustable.  Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  Oh and you have to do that after you are sitting under it.  So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix (notice I didnt say 'lock')the hood in place. If you set it up before you sit under it and happen to tip it ever so slightly it will collapse. If you so much as sneeze while under this dryer the hood will fall and hit you in the face.  I have not used it one time without this happening.  I miss my Lady Daisy terribly and this dryer makes me miss it more.  This dryer is also very loud.  Like shop vac loud with a strained whistle going at the same time.  It's just that bad.  I wish I never purchased it and can't wait to replace it.  If you need cheap heat this is fine.  If you are a die hard at home roller setter/wrapper/deep conditioner/wet setter/braid setter/twist outer/style molder/colorer then please spend a few extra coins for a better dryer.|neg
If you are looking for a good quality hair dryer without too many hairstyle requirements.It is a good choice. You have different choices of heat. Anyway, it meets my requirement.|pos
This hair dryer is compact, folds up, has a retractable cord and is powerful.  My husband loves the sleek design and the compactability.|pos
All I know is I straighten my hair almost every day now because instead of the old 8 minutes of drying time, this hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 2 1/2 minutes!  I love the retractable cord and it's small, sleek size.  Great buy for the price!|pos
This was purchased for a trip to Italy in February.  Indeed, I am a woman who plans ahead.  I used it Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday it blew out and I had to go to the grocery store to buy a new one, more powerful, that worked very well and cost the same.  Don't waste your money.|neg
Expensive but worth every penny. professional hair dryer with professional results. Cuts time spent in the bathroom drying my hair|pos
I absolutely love this blow dryer and the attatchments, I usually buy CHI for my blow dryer but the last one shorted out within a year so I decided on trying Hot Tools and I was in love. Multiple settings so you can dry/style your hair just right and the attachments work great for stying my bangs and straighening with the blow dryer. I would definitely buy Hot Tools and recommend this blow dryer to anyone.|pos
I've traditionally purchased Conair brand hair dryers (most recently, the Conair Eco Hair Dryer, which no longer appears to be available).  I needed to purchase a new one quickly, saw this one in a local store, and picked it up.<br /><br />This dryer has several very nice features.  First, it has three HEAT settings (hot, warm, cool) PLUS two STRENGTH settings (low and high).  In addition, you have the option of boost the air flow with the turbo button and also using the cool shot button to set your style.  I have found that what works best for me is to mostly dry my hair on the high heat-high power setting, then go down to the low power for a minute or two of styling.  Using this method, I am able to complete my overall drying time significantly more quickly than with my old hair dryer.  This dryer's nozzle is a bit longer than that of my old dryer, meaning that I bumped my head the first few times I used it, but I quickly got used to this.  For a larger dryer, I find it to be relatively lightweight and relatively quiet as well.<br /><br />Another feature of this dryer is the removable back to allow you to clean the lint screen; although I was attracted to this concept, I am unable to get the back off!  Perhaps we just have a dud, but it simply does not move.  Also, I should mention that the attachment is HUGE.  I hadn't really planned on using it anyway, but when I did try to snap it on to the dryer, I could not get it on easily.<br /><br />Overall, I have have been quite happy with this hair dryer--I just wish the back would come off.  My final rating is 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Edited 4/1/13:  Good news--I was able to get the back off this morning!  It seems like it just suddenly came unstuck when I tried it again (after many tries).  I was able to clean the filter and put the back back on, and now it comes off easily with a slight turn clockwise.  Still very happy with this hair dryer!|pos
My wife's blower was sounding like a tractor so we knew it was time.  Found this very inexpensive blower but ordered it because of the great ratings.  It's just the right size, has lot's of power and at $7.77, you can't beat the price.  She had purchased one for $30 at a local store before we found this one, but fortunately hadn't used it and was able to do a return.  One great feature is that the rear inlet screen can be totally removed to clean out the lint.  Great deal.|pos
Have used this for many years and can't live without it. Happy to have found it, will continue ordering it whenever needed.<br />Thanks.|pos
As long as my wife loves it...I'm happy.  She loves red and finally she has one with all the features she desires in a hair dryer.|pos
Can't complain about the quality of this product.  It's very much appreciated around here.  Everyone is using it to dry their hair.|pos
This is a 1600 watt dryer with 2 fan speeds!  Heats up quick and is very handy mounted on the bathroom wall, which, was very easy to do with the supplied screws.|pos
I am very happy with this dryer. I like the fact that it's light weight but does the job. Shipping was very fast. This will be great for traveling.|pos
Just got it and works great so far but then the first I got also worked but just after 1 year started to spark and smoke.  Not a lot of use.  Thought I would give sunbeam one more try.  Will update later.|pos
makes my hair shinier and it maintains the keratin treatment. it is lighter than the one I had before. it is not small, so that's a disadvantage if you are traveling. but it is powerful. recommend it|pos
I have been using drugstore brand (revlon, clairol, etc) hair dryers for years.  Recently, I found that no matter what brand I bought, the heat would go from hot to cold and the dryer took forever to dry my hair.  I decided to upgrade to a higher end dryer and am so thankful I did.  This dryer cuts the drying time in half and my hair is not frizzy.  I just went away for the weekend and every single one of my girlfriends asked to borrow my hair dryer and are now buying one.<br /><br />The dryer is a bit heavier than the drugstore brands but it's also twice as powerful.  The buttons do take a minute to get used to, but after a day they shouldn't be an issue anymore.<br /><br />I (and my girlfriends) would recommend this hair dryer to anyone.  I won't ever go back to the &#34;cheapies&#34; again.|pos
Dries fast and leaves my hair shiny and straight. Its a little loud, but it puts out a lot of air so I guess that is to be expected.|pos
This hair dryer has a good weight and feel. Solid consistant heat at different settings... A great buy at a great price.|pos
Love the small but powerful size. Used virtually daily for 5 years and just wore out. I immediately ordered an identical replacement . No clutter on countertop, cord hanger, just a great unit.|pos
We were looking for a replacement for our hair dryer that died. It needed to be powerful for long hair. This one does the job.|pos
My mom had this blowdryer and I fell in love! It's very powerful and dries your hair super fast!  Worth the money!|pos
Thank you for having this available for me to purchase at a decent price! A welcome addition to my wife's beautiy gadgets.|pos
This is exactly like one I used in a luxury hotel.  I was so impressed with it that I had to have one of my own.|pos
Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.|pos
Bought it for her for the birthday.  It is worth spending the extra couple of bucks over the other ones.  Makes a racket but they all do.  The thing I read about it being hard to get to the buttons is kind of ridiculous.  They are not difficult to push/ avoid pushing unless you have the most sausage of sausage fingers.  Apparently does not dry out her hair; or the dogs hair for that matter.|pos
I had use one many times in Hotels, when I found out I could order one,I ordered two.<br />I love mine,lot of power , blows hair dry great, I am glad I buy two.|pos
Great price for a great product. has a small light that turns on while your bathroom light is off, i would highly recommend it.|pos
Love this blow dryer! Does exactly what it says...dries fast with less frizz! Lighter weight and quiet motor, too. Would definitely recommend!!|pos
I've had it for over 2 months and love it so far!  I have no problems with the nozzle falling off, it blows my hair dry in 1/2 the time it took before, and my hair feels so much softer!  I love it!|pos
We use this in our guest rooms at Four Seasons - I recently bought it for the gym since it's a full size but you are able to fold the handle.  It's really quiet AND powerful - great value too.  The retractable cord is also great esp. for travel.|pos
i have never had a ionic hairdryer...i have no more frizz after i blow my hair out. i have for years used conditioner thinking this would help with the frizzing but i had no conditioner and my hair was just like at the salon with no frizz.|pos
I have had this hair dryer for about 6 months now and it works great. The night light is still on and works fine.|pos
****UPDATE 2nd order****<br />As below, I ordered a second replacement.  We got less than a year out of this one before the sparks started flying again.  Yes, we kept it clear of lint etc. [it has an easy to remove cap to do this] and the thing does not get daily use.  How one can last 3 years and the next only a year is beyond me.  I gave them a second chance....but no more.  One spark in the eye could ruin your vision for life.  Dangerous product to say the least.<br /><br />Purchased this in 2009 and since the sparks started flying out of the dryer this week I decided to leave a review.  It's worked flawless until today.  My wife was drying her hair and sparks started coming out the end.  This has happened before with other dryers thus the reason for my 4 star review.  I'm buying another one as it will match the holes on the wall that are already there and it's been a nice small hair dryer....and for the price, can't beat it lasting 3 years. Not too concerned about the sparks as the heating wires over time get thin from all the heat...it's almost something you expect to happen and no one was hurt in the process.  Overall a nice compact good looking unit.|neg
This hair dryer is exactly what we've been looking for and this is the only place we were able to find it.  It was easy to order, and the shipping time was short.  I will probably order again from amazon.com.|pos
It is a good thing that my limited edition Revlon blow dryer broke after only 6 months. Because I replaced it with the John Frieda full volume blow dryer this morning and I was simply stunned at the difference in quality. I have had many brands of blow dryers over the years and it has always taken me at least 10 minutes to completely blow dry my very thick hair. However this John Frieda blow dryer took my very thick, shoulder length hair from soaking wet to bone dry and ready for hot rollers in three minutes! Yes, you read that right... three minutes! This blow dryer is going to save me so much time when I am in a hurry and trying to get out the door. It is worth every single penny and then some. I love, love, love this blow dryer and highly recommend it!|pos
I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can't even remember the last one I wrote. However, I'm pretty inspired right now. This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it's always been. It's not frizzy, so I'm not doing tons of follow-up flat-ironing. And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I'm finished.<br /><br />Now, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I'm pretty sure this is the best purchase I've made in years.|pos
I wash and dry my hair everyday.  I used this hair dryer in a hotel and loved it!  I've been searching for a good hair dryer that didn't break the bank for years.  My husband also commented that it drys my hair quicker. It leaves my hair so soft.  My hairdresser even said I must be doing something right.  The retractable cord is great.  And, I love the folding handle for travel.|pos
I have curly hair and this hair dryer has a cold setting which helps to keep my curls from being frizzy.  My last hair dryer did not have a cold setting but just a freeze type button.  I actually wore out the button so I needed to purchase a new hair dryer.  I like that this dryer does not have a flimsy, lightweight feel. I also love that it is black with pink accents.  I am very glad I purchased this product.|pos
Do not underestimate the size of this dryer. My goodness this dryer is hottttt. I have weave in my hair and I decided to wash it and lord this dryer dried the hair within 10-15minutes. I really really really like it and for the price, you can't beat that. What more could you ask for.|pos
Great product. It dries my hair super fast. A friend of mine has had hers for years and I am hoping to as well!|pos
I have been using it for almost 3 years! I don't have anything negative to say about it! Love that it has different speed and heat settings. If anyone complains it is too big or heavy, well, I've got to say this is not a portable hair dryer.|pos
Its just what I wanted.and I am happy with it.  There is nothing more that I can say about this dryer with the exception that it is working very well.|pos
Not too loud, toggle switch is a nice feature, and most importantly... you can hold onto the &#34;head&#34; of the dryer without worrying about it getting too hot. I never like to hold the dryer from the designated handle region, so this was a really nice feature. Good price too. I used to use the babybliss dryers, but found they were too powerful for my hair, so I opted for this product, and I love it!|pos
Exactly what I was looking for. Love the retractable cord and the folding handle! Sturdy unit with good power. Would definately recommend!|pos
This has to be the best hair dryer I have ever used. My hair is thick and tends to get frizzy after I blow dry it. But with this dryer my hair is shinny and healthy looking rather then looking like I stuck my finger in a electric socket. It dries it quickly and gives it a more styled looked. Love this hair dryer and Would recommend it to anyone.|pos
This is a powerful, quick, perfect hair dryer. Definitely recommend it for salon professionals. The price is unreal ... It's better than the 150 dollar models I've had in the past.|pos
Great product.  My Daughter uses it everyday, this was a christmas gift and it's getting used, holding up just fine.  Shipment was fast and packaging was great.|pos
I have used the same Hello Kitty hair dryer almost every day for 5 years. It is light weight but not when it comes to heat and air. I have thick long hair and it dries quickly and smoothly. I like it so much I have purchased several for gran-daughters, girl friends and once as a bridal shower gift. Everyone has elaborated on how much they like this product and a few have carried on the gift choice to their family and friends. I had purchased them at Target but now, thanks to my Amazon Prime Shipping, I don't have to purchase, then spend money to ship|pos
I bought it because it's not very expensive and free shipping. It's very good quality and not so so big . Only thing is you can't fold it.|pos
I hope that Amazon fixed their search suggestions after I had to return this one with the related comments.<br />My wife loved it and has a similar but older model drier that still works ( for 5 years, I think).<br /><br />Anyway, I was looking for 220 Volt drier and had to return this one in the end|pos
The dryer works very well.  Dries hair quickly. Like the choice of settings  It is rather large so not suitable for travel|pos
Well the subject sais it all.  I scored big on this.  I bought it because of the reviews and I hit the jackpot.  My wife spent at least 15 minutes drying her hair each day.  My daughter has reached the age of needing to dry her hair each day so sharing the $20 target special had become a real hassle.<br /><br />The first morning my wife used it she was simply amazed how well it did.  She thought it might be a little hot for my daughter (age 11) but she was not sure.  We just gave her the cheap hair dryer and my wife is using this one.  I assume this will hold up well over time.  If we have any mechanical problems or anything negative develops then I will edit this review and add the updated information.  I give it 2 thumbs up!|pos
I love this hair dryer so much that I purchased two more to give to my daughters for Xmas. It is the most powerful hair dryer available with 2000 watts.  It's a professional dryer with a low price.|pos
I like the price, the compactness of it --  and it is easy to travel with.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends.|pos
shipped super quick!! the speeds in the dryer are extremely convenient esp love the cooling button has no heat at all unlike many dryers tht even with the cooling button, the air is still sort of warm|pos
I bought a Tescom hair dryer almost 10 years ago from a Japanese chain that is locally owned where I live, very similar to this one except without the extra styling attachment. That had been the best hair dryer I had owned, and the American market doesn't have any (nothing of the same quality at least) as the one I'd had. So after a good nearly 10 years, the Tescom retired itself and I needed a replacement. I did a search for the same brand and several Panasonics came up. Panasonic in Japan makes great quality products so after a little searching and looking through reviews I ordered this model - mainly because of the adjustable styling brush AND it was dual voltage (I'd hate to have to get a voltage converter for something that is everyday use). This hair dryer is way better than the one I'd had for so long and I love it! Great for styling my bangs and giving my layers a little bit of body and slight curl at the ends. I would highly recommend this product to ladies who hate having to try and style their hair with a traditional blow dryer and a round brush.|pos
This hairdryer works particularly well for my fine hair in that it does not &#34;overcook&#34; it as there are multiple settings to choose from. You can choose from 3 heat settings as well as 3 force settings, and lastly there is a &#34;cool shot of air&#34; setting. All of these options have allowed my frequently highlighted hair to remain somewhat healthy looking as opposed to the blowdryers that use maximum heat all the time. I would definitely recommend.|pos
The entire body of this dryer is a matte, somewhat grippy plastic. Really smart feature.<br /><br />Everything else is fine. Buttons, weight, loudness. No issues at all. It dries hair and doesn't blow out eardrums or melt cartilage.<br /><br />Can't write about the long-term reliability, because I've only had it for a couple of weeks. So far, so good.|pos
The hardest part of having your old hair dryer die on you is getting used to a new one.<br />This hair dryer is fabulous and so quiet compared to my old one!|pos
I was actually surprised.  My hairdresser recommended a home unit since I like to sit under her hairdryer and read.  A great treat at home!|pos
It is easy to use and works great.  I have been using since it came and It works as described.|pos
Fast blow drying,travel size, lightweight and great price. What more could I need? I am a  professional hair stylist, but I use this for personal drying. Works or me!|pos
Even better than the Revlon version i had before. Controls are easier to use and it isn't too heavy in my hands.|pos
This is typical hair drier I saw all the time at my fitness center, nothing fancy but a work horse, it works fine, and it's reliable, that's all I was looking for.|pos
i have owned a few of these before, same style and model. they are very dependable. i love having them mounted on the wall in the bathroom.|pos
It makes my hair straight. I love it. The smaller nozzel focuses the heat where i want it. Strong and powerful.|pos
Best hair dryer ever. It reduces my drying time from almost 1 hour 30 minutes to just 45 minutes, eliminating all frizz.|pos
This hair dryer works extremely well and folds and stores neatly in a drawer. The retractable cord is easy to use with just a push of the button.|pos
It is tiny little thing. Pretty much doll size but blows stronger than my normal hair dryer. Definitely recommend it.|pos
THIS IS A GREAT HAIR DRYER!!! IF YOU WANT TO DRY YOUR WET HAIR QUICKLY, DONT BE HEISTED, CHOOSE THIS.|pos
I love how light weight this hair dryer is, and how quick it gets my hair dry!  I have curly hair and it does not make it frizz.  Love it!|pos
Great product. Arrived on Time as it said it would no complaints + ) = ) =0 =) = )|pos
I typically don't use hair dryers, but I initially bought this product because I was sick and tired of my hair being wet when I left for work (especially during winter).<br /><br />My wife used this one time and loved it so much, that she has now started to use it herself! One day, she used her old one (I guess to compare power and dry time) and it now seems incredibly weak.  My caution is that this hair dryer will become the standard by which you judge all other dryers!<br /><br />*Important note: For those of you who buy this and don't typically use hair dryers, there is no directions that tell you that the &#34;fan button&#34; has to be turned on, AND THEN the heat button.  The heat button does not start it by itself.|pos
I had similar 1875W Revlon before, this one is slightly smaller. The air blow out got the same feeling and speed of heating up. For a hair dryer, it works ...|pos
This one taught me the error of my ways.  Power/ drying much better.  Sturdy construction and really nice texture. too - won't slide off the counter.  Very much worth a bit more money to get a quality piece of equipment.|pos
I have used this dryer several times.  I like the settings and also the fact that it isn't too heavy for it's size.  Also, the price was right and it had other good reviews.|pos
Up to now I have not received this product. One attempt was made to deliver the product and no more.Now the product that I really need is apparently on its way back to the seller according to fedex. I'm very very disappointed to say the least.|neg
This hair dryer seems to work well for all hair types. It blows hot and helps with coarse or unruly hair types.|pos
When I ordered this styler I thought I was getting the (older) one that folds. The two models look very similar - I would think they are the same unless I look very closely at the picture. The reason why I was getting an extra one was because I was very satisfied with the old model - Light, small, dual-voltage, strong.<br /><br />This newer model works the same and looks the same. It just doesn't fold. The folding one is actually, IMHO, easier to bring when traveling.|pos
LOVE LOVE LOVE this item. The heat control is amazing! Dries my VERY curly hair extremely fast & leaves it soft and shiny. A must have!|pos
I put this in a rental condo and it is terrific. The LED night light is a wonderful feature to the unit.|pos
Great for at home or salon used! I gave it as a present to one of my clients that needed a dryer!|pos
IT WORKS PERFECT.  it is a really cheap product. It is lake a professional hair dryer, with AC motor, 2200 W and tourmalina.|pos
I have wavy hair and had pretty much given up trying to get it straight on a regular basis  When I use this dryer it not only gets straight, but stays that way for the day.  Now I can at least approximate the look I have coming out of a salon - love it!|pos
Easy to use. It is quiet and soft. Not burn your hair. Cool dryer option is also great to use.|pos
WORKS WELL AND THE COLOR IS BETTER THEN SHOWN MORE LIKE NEON GREEN!  DEFINITELY A GOOD PURCHASE - GAVE AS A GIFT|pos
I was dismayed when my Andis Hang-Up died because I had screwed it to the wall and I didn't want to fill screw holes, so I was delighted to find it still available on Amazon. The new unit came with a novel night-light feature, which failed immediately, leaving an unpleasant smell of burnt plastic and an oily black soot deposit on the handle. The hair dryer still ran, but it filled my hair with the smell of an electrical fire. I sent it back to Amazon who promptly replaced it. The night light on the second unit again immediately failed, although without the odor of the other one. I'm still using it and I really like the hair dryer, but it appears to me that the night light is just not ready for prime time and may actually constitute a fire hazard.|neg
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She's a stylist, so I took a chance that she wouldn't like it, but she loved it and replaced her old hairdryer with this one.|pos
The dryer is quiet and calm running, the bonnet is is just the right fit with or without rollers . it has a nice handsome look.  It is sturdy and strong.<br /><br />Great temper control the timer has a slight ticking sound, and the bell rings when time is up awesome, coasters are convent and easily moves where you want it.  Perfect for a home beauty aid. Would recommend to all looking for a home style salon look.|pos
I brought this dryer from walmart it was 25 with shipping.  Anywho this is the best for deep conditioning! even though the back doesnt get that hot as the front its very warm. So far i love this product.|pos
I had my old GE wall type hair dryer for 13 years.  Sadly it passed away.  I had the old metal bracket on the wall and thought &#34;if only I could get the same dryer to fit the old bracket.  I wasn't eager to start filling the holes and repainting the spot and maybe the whole bathroom if I couldn't match the wall color.<br />Yippee!  I ordered one that looked similar and attached over the old bracket.<br />The new dryer is perfect!|pos
Used one of these in a hotel and liked it so much we came home and ordered one.  It was delivered quickly and in great condition.|pos
I was very pleased with the shipping and packaging. I like the temperature settings, the way it folds and how the cord retracts inside. Mostly pleased with the handle for holding it while drying my hair. Some dryers don't feel like they are correctly made for holding. This one does. I would recomend this hair dryer to everyone. Thanks.|pos
i love the turbo blow dryer its the best the price is totally woth buying :-D it works wonders :-)|pos
Christmas present. Wife is pleased. What more can I say? It seems like a well made quality item. Nuff' said.|pos
My daughter-in-law picked this gift to her wish list for Christmas, we bought it, and it is working very well.|pos
Just get it! O_O that's how good it is.... no words can explain how well this thing works. I love mine! Had my eyes on it for years now and now that I have it.....I'm very pleased and glad that I bought it.|pos
works great  but there is too much noise, i bought it for my girl friend and she loves it very much.|pos
I love this hair dryer.  It drys my hair real fast and it is easy to store with the folding handle|pos
IT DOES A GREAT JOB AND IS UP AND OUT OT THE WAY~IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS  OFF WHICH IS GREAT AWESOME|pos
I bought this for a friend for Christmas. SHe really likes it because it very light and the temperature controls move easily.|pos
Easy to use dry your hair fast easy to carried is light weight.  you can take it anywhere in that house I usually watch tv while my hair is getting dry. ❤|pos
I used a small 10 dollar travel hair dryer for 2 years as my main dryer.  It took soo long to dry my long hair.  With this dryer, it's dry in 2 minutes not even! It's so strong! But I love being able to set the heat several ways.  Very customizable.  The cord is amazing! It stays inside the dryer and out of my way when it's not in use.  I also love the color.  It's not as pink as it looks in the picture. It's more marroon but, still pretty.  I highly recomend!|pos
I love it and Use is very convenient<br /> This product is valuable, and the price is not expensive, worth buying!|pos
We have four of these now. They are great product and work as described. Would recommend to friends. Would order again.|pos
This is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders. It takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer, but that only takes one or two uses.|pos
I love this blow dryer! I was tired of taking 5 minutes to blow dry my thick hair so I went on a search for something that would be faster. So many say they blow dry faster but this one really does. So glad I purchased this. I no longer dread blow drying!|pos
light weight, easy to manage does a great job.  Mom is 90 years old and this unit is perfect for her needs.|pos
Excellent dryer easy to put together, controls are awesome,all you need is one tool included with the dryer.<br /><br />Roy, Woodbridge, VA|pos
While staying in a motel I used this and fell in love! My hair comes out smoother.. love the multiple settings.. this works so well I purchased a second for when my new one wears out!!! Good blow dryers are hard to come by.|pos
Works great, stylish and is a great gift for anybody who tends to take care of their hair a lot. Package came right on time, in good condition and holds its worth.|pos
Great hairdryer! I love the multi settings to dry your hair and it was exactly what I was looking for as a gift for my daughter.  She wanted the Ion tool so it was perfect for her. Thanks.|pos
hari dryer was exactly as described . very quick delivery for xmas runs grevery happyat would recomend for purchase very happy|pos
This is definitely lighter than my last hair dryer. It is pretty quiet too. I wish the detachable nozzle went on easier & was a little longer. My only complaint is regarding the length of the nozzle. They call it the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment. When I am styling my bangs or blowing out my hair with a round brush - it makes the dryer too close to my head / hair and it makes styling more difficult.  My last hair dryer's attachment was longer with an air flow vent - to keep the air from blasting you in the head. I guess this will take some getting used to. Other than that - seems to be good quality. The plus is that it does dry my hair faster and with less noise.|pos
i bought the &#34;used&#34;/open box item - no idea what was wrong with it - it looked like i got it off of the store shelf.|pos
The raving reviews about this hair dryer are all correct: it dries hair faster! its sound isn't as obnoxious as others! it's small! compact! cute! However, it only lasted about 10 months. We used it almost every day, or at least every other day, to dry my 3-year-old's hair. Typically we used the low setting, and occasionally the high setting. The cool air button was great, too, but we rarely used it. It died suddenly, with no warning sign, after about 9-10 months. DISAPPOINTED!|neg
I used an Andis 1875 hair dryer in a hotel and loved it but when I ordered it online, I got a different product.  The product I got is an Andis 1875 but it isn't the same.  I'm disappointed in the one I got because it's not as powerful as the one at the hotel.|neg
Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent|pos
I purchased this dryer for my wife. She loves how quickly it works and leaves her hair feeling soft, and not static-free. It was a pre-Christmas gift, and here in Michigan the air is pretty dry this time of year, so I am officially impressed. There must be something to the whole ionic ceramic tourmaline thing.<br /><br />One of the minuscule clear rubber pieces in the handle dropped off when she took this dryer out of the box. It's not a critical component, but I hope it's not an indication of the dryers build quality and expected longevity. Given how the much less expensive, shortly lived, noisy, less effective dryers she has had in the past have been, I'm not too concerned though.|pos
We have one already just like it and the wife loves it and that is why we bought another one.A Bargain.Our old one is 6 years old and we are ready for the new one.|pos
The product details never mentioned that the dryer has to be hard-wired to an electrical outlet since it doesn't come with a plug.  As a result I returned the dryer because I wanted a traditional plug-in type, however none of the other product reviews mention anything about this so I decided not to order via Amazon until the product details are more accurate.|neg
this product dries hair efficiently and quickly. It includes 2 heat settings and a cool boost button just like the more expensive models.|pos
My daughter bought this hairdryer first and I kept borrowing hers. Finially decided to buy my own and I am very happy with the dryer. It is a light weight and packs a lot of pwer. Goes from hot to cold in seconds. I am very happy with the hairdryer and hope it lasts for years.|pos
I had my previous Vidal Sassoon hair dryer for a VERY long time.  My own stupidity was actually its undoing. I tried to clean off the grate inside by opening the unit and ended up not putting it back together quite right, burning out the motor. Soooo I had to get another hair dryer.  I decided on this one for the price and ratings for the most part. It is heavier probably because of the ceramic inside. I only use it to quickly dry my short hair after a shower so it works great for that. I probably got more than I need in a hair dryer but it does work for me and it works swell. It is the bees knees! Don't know what that means exactly and I am younger than that saying is....but it is kinda fun saying it anyway.|pos
It Looks like the Sunbeam 1200 model that we have had forever, & that is found in most hotel rooms, but not near as good.  The dryer doesn't snap in like it should.|neg
Works great. Exactly what I expected. Love the retractable cord, and it has enough power to dry my hair quickly.|pos
This item arrived quickly and just as advertised. I love it.....it dries my thick hair in a flash. Try it!|pos
It's absolutely amazing.  My wife claims she never knew a blow dryer could make such a change in the way you style your hair.  Worth the price.|pos
I've had this dryer for only 8 months and the high speed setting no longer works. I would have rated this very highly had it continued to function properly, but for the cost of this dryer, lasting less than a year is completely unacceptable.|neg
This hairdryer is very nice, I have full thick hair and it will have it mostly dry in about 2 minutes, I have also managed to drop it about 20 times since I got it and its still running like a  champ.|pos
What I love about this is that it is fairly quiet, and yet seems to dry my hair quickly.  I especially like the concentrator, as it has a small opening and really works as I'm shaping my hair.  My hair is wavy, and I try to straighten it as I shape the style.  Using my round brush, the concentrator focuses on each section and dries it straight.|pos
Worked great the first 4 months and then died unexpectedly without warning.  Not pleased - would have expected to get at least a year out of it!|neg
So far very happy with the performance of this dryer. My daughter said it really helps minimize the frizzies you get with some hair dryers. I'm hopeful it will last at least a year or two. So many hair dryers quit before you have gotten your money's worth!|pos
This was a great dryer while it lasted.  I loved all the different settings because I could use it on my small dod with no problems.  It did dry hair faster.  After 2 years the electric safety plug blew and the hairdryer is bricked.<br /><br />I just bought another cheaper Andis and see it has a 5 year warranty.  If this one had a 5 year warranty too I wish someone had said or posted something or wish I saw it if it was listed on the box if it was offered.  If you notice this ad makes no mention of warranty.<br /><br />This was a good but heavy dryer while it lasted.  2 lbs I think.  I liked the range in heat and speed of airflow much better than what I replaced this with.  The variety in heat and speed worked out perfect for the dog and me.  My dog preferred the low warm or hot while I preferred fast and hot.  The weight of the dryer didn't bother me at all.<br /><br />Did I gyp myself out of warranty on this dryer?  I sure hope not because I already threw it away  :(|pos
This blow dyer rocks. Effective, for Brand name is affordable. What I like most about it, it is super quite, yet very powerful.|pos
this is a goo product.  hair dresser recommended and uses one.  not sure how the pearl effect is supposed to sustain itself from the ceramic but oh well.  it does what it's supposed to do and I would recommend this to anyone looking for  a quality hair drier.  it was deliverd quickly and was packaged to arrive safely.|pos
My daughter loves this dryer. She enjoys using all the attachments and says it dries her long hair very quickly.|pos
High powered and compact, it is the perfect little travel blow dryer.  I also love the little attachable defuser and straightener.  Way too cute and works amazingly well.|pos
I bought two of this because my sisters, enrolled in a beauty salon school, and they tell me it is truly amazing, just keep in mind that this is a professional dryer, and if used without caution, it may burn some ones hair, because it is that powerful!|pos
Conair YB075W Pro Yellowbird is really most excellent. This hair dryer is sturdy and well built. Definitely worth the money.|pos
This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. Dries my hair quickly and does not make a lot of noise.|pos
Bought this particular item based on positive reviews from Amazon customers.<br />Gave one to my daughter who thought it was quieter than her old dryer and dried her hair quick.<br />Gave one to my mother who thought it was noisy and a bit heavy, but dried her hair very quick.<br />(My mom is the pickiest person on earth....so take it with a grain of salt).<br />Remington sells matching pink hairbrushes, which makes it really gifty.|pos
The blow dryer I had since high school finally died so I bought a new one. There's nothing special about this hair dryer, but there's definitely nothing wrong with it. Nice, powerful stream of air with the option of cooler air, hotter air - and high and low power. It works quickly on my fine hair and on my daughter's thicker hair.|pos
It made my hair look very smooth and the retractable cord is really great. Just what I was looking for!|pos
I have bought it for my wife, she loved it. She does not has to go work with wet hair anymore :D. I recommend it.|pos
Love this dryer, I have had it for a long time now. works like new.|pos
It is a hair dryer - what can I say.  It is what I wanted for the price.  I am happy with it.|pos
the review was great. High Power!!!! Great Heat. Would reccomend this product to all..Perfect Wall mount Hair Dryer.. Quiet and easy to install.|pos
i love this hairdryer, im no professional but it does the job and its affordable. I would recommend it to anyone.|pos
What's the difference between a man's hair dryer and a woman's?  I have no idea.  I would think a man's hair dryer would have 2 settings: Off and On.  This one has a combination of settings and I have no idea what their purposes are.  It will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds, if that appeals to you.  I tend to just use hot and high.  I'm not real sure about the ions but it all sounds very scientific so I just leave that on.<br /><br />At any rate, I've had it for a couple of months now and have had no problems with it.  It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).  This calls for a more even application of heat so the ability to remove the nozzle was actually handy.<br /><br />Overall I can't imagine how it could be better.<br /><br />I suppose it could dispense donuts but I can't really dock them a star for that oversight, I guess.|pos
This hair dryer is much more quiet than my previous hairdryer, which was an adjustable ionic hairdryer.  It has this interesting grippy material around the outside which is very attractive and comfortable to hold.  It is lightweight and has three temperature and three speed settings. I don't think it gets super hot, which is good for me since I have fine hair and do not wish to dry it out.  My hair was incredibly soft after using this dryer.|pos
This hair dryer is worth the price.  It drys my hair much faster then my Chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more so I don't have the fly away look.  My hairdresser recommended this hair dryer.|pos
Soory to have to say I bought this for a Christmas gift for a little girl. As far as I know, it has been fine.|pos
Will always buy T3 Hairdryers from now on... best investment. This hairdryer is amazing... and now cheaper since it's not the most current version. I can't imagine a better hairdryer. Dries my hair super fast, and the dryer itself is super light!|pos
I had been using an awful 8 year old, non-ionized dryer until I purchased this one... and I cannot say enough good about this product.  The temperature and output controls are fantastic;  it was definitely worth the money.|pos
This hairdryer is the lightest and quietest I've ever used.  In fact, my husband now wants one of his own!|pos
We picked a wall mount because she was always leaving her hair dryer plugged in, right next to the sink (that's a terrible accident just waiting to happen).  After trying unsuccessfully to get her to unplug it and put it away, I realized her life would be a whole lot easier if I just got her a wall mount hair dryer and deliberately mount it next to where she stands in front of the sink rather than mount it right next to the sink itself.  That solves a lot of problems: she doesn't have to use up drawer space for the dryer, I don't have to worry about her putting it away hot, it is always plugged in and ready, the coil cord never drags over the sink (so nothing getting knocked off the sink), and of course the risk of the dryer falling into the sink is practically eliminated.<br /><br />This hair dryer is conveniently small so it's easy to handle, even for a young teen with long hair.  It dries hair quickly because it is powerful despite its size.<br /><br />Wall mounting was trivially simple -- it took less than five minutes with my hand dandy drill/driver, bits, level, and a hand screwdriver (it is much better to use a manual screwdriver instead of a drill/driver to screw into wall anchors).  It comes with a wall template with a leveling line which makes the job go especially quickly.|pos
This was a piece of crap.  I used it once where the air flow was so weak I figured I'd have better luck drying my hair if my friend blew on it.  The 2nd time I attempted to use it, it sparked and died.  I left it in a trash can in Paris.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY!!!!|neg
This hair dryer is amazing.  Just like the one they use in my salon, and it costs so much less!  This is my second one as I loved my first one so much, when it died I bought the same thing!|pos
I bought this blow dryer because my friend had one and loved it. Well, I love mine too! This dryer will dry your hair quickly without causing damage. It also reduces frizz really well, especially when used with a round brush. They sell this exact same hair dryer at the salon where I get my hair cut... at three times the price!!! I would highly recommend! This is a great deal.|pos
This blow dryer is awesome! Beautiful. The body of the dryer is nice a soft. Nice material used on it. And this dryer works very well. It's just so sleek and fun to use. I would give it 10 stars if I could.|pos
I have this same model...but a much older version.  I've probably had it for at least 8 years.  I never had any problems with it until the last year or so.  The button to retract the cord broke within this last year.  But the dryer continued to work.  Lately, it has started to get hot while using it and if I turn it off it won't turn back on until it cools down.  My husband says it's because it has a lot of dust in it.  He could take it apart and clean it out and it would probably last for several more years, but I miss the retractable cord.  I am looking for a new hair dryer and will very possibly get this same model.  I think I paid less than $20 for it.  You can't beat that for value in a hair dryer that lasted so long.|pos
I bought this hair dryer for my girlfriend. She has long thick hair and gets tired of all the maintenance it takes. She has been very happy with this product. It works quickly and doesn't damage her hair.|pos
This is a very nice hair dryer. The fan blows very strong, the heat is good, and the item is solid.|pos
Next best thing to being at the hair salon.  Have not had a chance to use much, but worked great the 2 times I used..|pos
Great way to save counter space, well constucted hair dryer, high speed is fast and hot, makes for a quick dry.|pos
Light, compact and dries my hair really fast. That's exactly what I needed for day to day use and for travel.|pos
I was looking for an Ionic drier because of how quick it manages my medium length hair. I wasn't worried about compact or travel.<br /><br />It feels heavy enough to be quality, but not too heavy to use. The settings are good, although I expected a little more power from the high blower setting - but with the ionic tech it doesn't need to blow harder.<br /><br />The cool blast button doesn't react as quickly as turning the heat setting to low.<br /><br />For function, it's perfectly fine, no complaints with function.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like which is a &#34;feature&#34;, is the soft matte finish.  It's pretty when it's new, but it gets scuffed and smudged with styling products and isn't pretty.  I'm not one to clean my styling appliances so often but this one needs a wipe down more often than not. It's not terrible, but I don't like it, and it wasn't an issue with my former drier.<br /><br />There are so many products out there which are comparable, it's really hard to decide. I'm not 'super excited', but I'm happy.|pos
Two words: noisy and dangerous!<br />It is not necessary to explain noisy...<br />Dangerous because the inner part is definitely not well protected.<br />Besides that, it takes too long to dry a hair that should had being completely dried in 5 minutes.<br />I send my back.|neg
This was a gift for my sister, and it was a great buy for the price. A very well made hair dryer.|pos
Love it.  It really works really well and is compact and light..It heats ups fast and gets the job done.Thanks|pos
This little gadget does exactly what it was made for, hold my dryer.  I had an inferior one before that was always falling, usually in the middle of the night, waking us.  As I am disabled, I need my rest & I need something to hold my dryer.  This works so well, I got one for my mother, too.|pos
This is an item that my girlfriend requested on her wishlist, and i got it for her. She loves it, and apparently it is amazing. I am bald now, so I have no need for such things, but it's nice to know I bought her something that is great at drying the hair one might have.|pos
Our old Conair started making noises about a month ago so we bought this thinking we would need it some morning.  The old one is still running, with a little noise, but it is the earlier version of this one and we have been happy with it.|pos
I already have one of thise, but because I travel a lot, I have one at home and one for my travel trailer. Lots of heat & power in a small little dryer.|pos
Man, let me tell ya, this thing really blows; and I mean that in a good way.<br />Buy one, it will blow you away..lol|pos
Really love it. Have been using it for two months and it works great. The price is awesome, $7.79 with free shipping using Prime. Light weight, quiet sound and fast speed to dry my hair. Can't find any problem with it. Highly recommend.|pos
I got this during the Black Friday madness and LOVE it! It has all the tips and ends anyone would need. Great buy!|pos
Just only use about one and half month, when I was using it and the Dryer stopped working suddenly. it's some part of inside the dryer was broken I guess and I really want to return this item！I was very angry about the quality of this dryer!|neg
i like it  ,work very good,i will recommend it yo my friends,I'm sure they will love it like me+  good price.|pos
This is a great product. It is really simple to hang, works well, and keeps the countertops clutter-free. We have been so happy with it, we've purchased the Sunbeam one each time... years in-between - it lasts well.|pos
product of very good quality, impeccable wine .. recommend the truth .. I hope to continue buying ... 100% original product ..|pos
I read several good reviews on this product and purchased it immediately.<br />It works great. My wife is very satisfied with this hair dryer.<br />I am considering buying a second one for my daughter.|pos
I have thick hair and it is really hard to get my hair dries in under 30 min but this hair dryer does it everytime. love the fact that the handle folds to save space and as its been dropped  a few times i know it is well put together and sturdy i would recommend tis product.|pos
Pros:  doesn't over-dry hair to a crisp. Love the settings and switch options and easy one-handed access when changing modes. My two hair-stylists bought one because they liked mine so much and the great price.<br /><br />Cons:  My first model broke after 14 months. I only use it 3-4 times a week. The heating element died. My husband is a electrical engineer and took it apart and couldn't fix it. It feels like a waste to throw such a nice blow dryer away, but I liked it enough to by another one of the same model. Just hope it lasts longer.|pos
Fast, doesn't burn, doesn't weaken over time. Love it! My grandmother is a professional hair dresser and she recommended this for personal, at-home use due to a good blend of price and quality.|pos
I tried it once and it came on with full power and then about 2 minutes in, the drying power was cut in half. There was nothing I could do to get it to come back on with full power. The highest setting was now merely a trickle of air. No idea what happened, but not going to buy it again.|neg
Extremely lightweight yet dries hair in record time, leaving it with a wonderful shine.  Also much quieter than my previous blowdryer, which is an added bonus.|pos
I received this as a gift and love it!  I have naturally curly hair and live in an area of high humidity.  This dryer dries my hair and leaves it smooth rather than fly away.|pos
Dryer is tiny and comes with a travel bag including 2 attachments; the handle does not fold. It's a real nice product overall.|pos
it was awesome!! i love the blow dry its amazing!! very happy with it!!! yayyyyyyyyyy my hair is ffaaaabbbuulloooouusss!! im like a professional hairdresser with this tool!!|pos
I bought this because my boyfriend didn't have one and I'm not used to air drying my hair when I shower at his place. He also needed one to dry off his dogs after washing them. I did my research and this one had great reviews and was the cheapest. I thought the item would be bigger but to my surprise it was a portable size so that was even better! The low setting is too low for me and drying my hair on the high setting was perfect. It even has a removable cap on the back for you to clean. For the price I paid, it definitely does its job and dried my hair quick! I would highly recommend this product to anyone!|pos
My wife had one of these for years and it finaly quit<br />Bought this one and She loves it. She loves it I Love it|pos
got this for my mom, her old hair dryer stopped. she loves this one. and when it is on hot, it is hot|pos
Saw one in Vegas hotel, had to have one.  Retractable cord is awesome if you're one to store dryer after each use.|pos
My sister in law is hairdresser and bought me one for my 35th bday. After 10 years of using it every day it finally quit. I have very long and thick hair and this is the best hair dryer since it dries my hair quickly. I went online to Amazon to buy a new one and am thrilled. Would never go back to cheap dryer that hardly works again. You have to go Turbo!! You'll be very happy you did.|pos
THIS BLOW DRYER IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!  MY NIECE ASKED FOR ONE AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT AFTER USING MINE.  THERE SIMPLY IS NO BETTER BLOW DRYER OUT THERE, AND I HAVE TRIED THEM ALL!!!|pos
High heat setting is practically automatic (don't have to wait for it to heat up).  And the blower on the high setting is very powerful.  This unit is even better than the ones we've used at hotels.  Highly recommend.|pos
My daughter had used this dryer in a hotel while traveling for work & she loved it.  It was at the top of her Christmas wish list, so it was one of the most appreciated gifts she received.  She assures me it is the best dryer she has ever used.|pos
I bought two of these for ourrental beach cottage so renters wouldn't have to use up space.  I just bought a third one.  I've used it myself while staying at the beach cottage and it's great!!|pos
On my second try here.  Features and performance is great, but first one failed after short time.  If this one doesn't last longer, there won't be a third.|pos
Great, convenient product. My husband had one and it lasted for years. He looked all over for another one, and was really happy to find this one that would fit in his small bathroom.|pos
I bought this dryer after using my mom's similar dryer and reading the reviews for this one. I totally love it. I have very thick long hair and it took close to an hour to fully blow dry my hair with my old conair dryer. This one dried my hair in literally about 5 minutes. It is also very light. I wish it was a tax quieter but overall I am more than pleased with my purchase.|pos
I bought one for myself.  My mom used it and was amazed.  So I got her one also.  It really makes a difference.  I dye my hair a lot, and this dryer doesn't make my hair look like hay. Edit...looks like it barely lasted 3 years. Seems short to me...I've had dryers last a lot longer.|pos
For the money you can't beat it. Plus it comes with attachments!! I would definitely buy this if you are looking for a new blow dryer and not interested in spending too much money.|pos
Best hotel dryer I have ever used ( I travel a lot ), so I purchased one for myself.  Love it!  I have had no problems in the year+ that I've had it.|pos
My daughter confiscated my older travel hair dryer so I decided to replace it with this one.  Maybe I should thank her because this dryer is FAR superior to my other one.  Even though it's only 1600W, it puts out a lot of air and my hair dries in no time.  I love the fact that it's a lower wattage as many older hotels throughout Europe can't handle anything higher.  How do I know?  I purchased an 1800W dual voltage one time and managed to blow out half the circuits in an old hotel in Venice.|pos
I used one similiar to this in a hotel and loved it. So I ordered me one. This is a great product and i would reccomend this product !!!!! A+ A+ A+.|pos
This hair dryer is fantastic and quite strong for being so small.  The best part is the dual voltage feature--it works wherever you travel.|pos
It feels like cheap flimsy plastic to the touch but it' s a pretty decent hair drier for the price. One thing i didn't like is that the concentrator can only be put one one way (like in the pic) because the opening is oval rather than round, i had a feeling it was oval as the picture wasn't too clear. I like holding the hair dryer in a different way but with the concentrator being oval i can not adjust it to my needs.    Update: after using this hair drier for 2 years, one day the handle got super hot and red and burnt smell started coming out of it. I disposed it right away. Not safe! Be careful.|neg
This ranked second in dryers in my price range; the first was cited as easy to accidentally change the setting. I love this dryer- works fast, strong flow, retractable cord is a plus, hand weight is comfortable.|pos
This is a nice dryer for the price.  Seems a bit heavy, but it works for me.  Dries my thick hair thoroughly.|pos
Have had this for a little over a year now.  It is extremely lightweight and feels very good quality.  Plenty of different settings and all of them work well.  Good airflow and it is plenty hot or cool enough.|pos
This hairdryer was a really good buy, and my daughter really loved having her own without having to borrow mom's hairdryer every day! It is a nice hairdryer.|pos
Christmas Present for my wife.<br />I now know more about Hair dryers than I ever hoped to know, but she loves it and that is all that matters. She says it is the best she has ever owned.|pos
I mention that comes with both attachments in the subject because I was confused when I first bought it I thought it came just with the concentrator not with the diffusor but what was my surprise when I opened the box it came with both which are wonderful! I have curly hair and it worked perfectly on me|pos
The product Worked well<br />I Would recommend<br />I Would buy again<br />Arrived on time as stated online<br />Very Cost effective|pos
You can't get excited over a hair dryer. It works , it dries and thats all it has to do.|pos
I got this hair dryer for Christmas, and I love it! The retractable cord is perfect for the limited space of my bathroom, The attachments work really well and my hair dries quickly. The only &#34;iffy&#34; thing about it is it doesn't seem to get as hot as my old dryer, but this may actually be better for my hair.|pos
I love love love this hair dryer. I have had it for quite a while, and it has been amazing. Great for blowing my hair straight, never burns, and dries very quickly.|pos
I bought this product after reading about it in a magazine.  I love it.  It drys my hair very quickly and without frizz!|pos
product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use|pos
Pretty nice dryer for such a low price. The device works fine for me. And it has many features such as the interruption key for temporally disable the heater and blowing cold air.|pos
Great little hair dryer that gives you what you need without being too huge or expensive.  Great for small spaces, after gym, people that MUST travel with a dryer, and I imagine, people with easy to manage hair.  This is definitely a no-frills, standard, and simple dryer.  If you're looking for low maintenance, low budget, easy, this is it!|pos
I am a retired hairdresser ,for years I have found that Revlon blow dryers just keep going, this one is strong enough to get thick hair the heat is needs for a great blow out.I have my pro blow dryer but with tweenagers always around, having this for them to use at the house is great and nice to have in the guest bath. Very happy with the quality and durabilty.|pos
Works well and I don't feel like I'm damaging my hearing when using it.  Shipped quickly.  Stores well and electrical cord recoil is cool.|pos
Great product! I bought one for a gift and one for myself! Easy to use, doesn't get to hot, and lightweight!|pos
I bought this hair dryer a few months ago to replace my old one (a different brand). This new hair dryer is as powerful as my last one (which I loved), but much quieter and my hair does not feel frizzy afterwards. My only complaint is that the handle is peeling a little at the bottom.|pos
Great product at a great price. Provides just the right temperature, and dries very well. Have had no issues with it since purchase. Highly recommended.|pos
This is one of the best hair dryers I have ever used.  It is very quiet and light.  Since it's an Ionic it leave your hair smooth and shiny.  It's a full size hairdryer but travels very well since it's so lightweight.  I would highly recommened it..|pos
I have used this for a couple of weeks now and am very pleased with this hair dryer.  It was not overly expensive and works very well, quickly drying the hair.|pos
I am picky about hairdryers because they always make a very loud sound but I feel like the power and force just isn't there. This Conair I have been very happy with.It is strong and take an adequate time to dry my hair. If this ever dies, I will buy this same dryer again.|pos
Have used it for over two months now and love it.  Easy to install and the cord stays neat on the hook.  Powerful enough to dry my short and in less than 3 minutes. My main reason for purchasing this was to find something I could hang-on the wall for easy access to use daily and to have it stored nicely in our main bathroom when not in use.|pos
I did not purchase this on Amazon..I purchased from a local Sally's after my Gold N Hot (see my review) died a few weeks after purchase.  The attachment to this one seals really well and it dries like a pro!  True tourmaline technology..though most dryers say the hair will dry silky and without frizz..this one ACTUALLY does the trick.  Most other brands do not.  My hair was so straight I really could have just curled it instead of flat ironing.  Really Really nice dryer.  Great replacement for the junk I thought was a good product.|pos
It's a hairdrier and it works. The true test is how long it will last... and unfortunately, I won't likely come back and review it in a few years.|pos
i love this blow dryer. it's so quiet and it does an outstanding job. :) my friend had lended me hers and i loved it so i went out and purchase one of my own.|pos
After using this blow dryer at a Renaissance Hotel, I was surprised at how soft it made my hair feel with absolutely no frizz.  Another plus, it also dried my medium-textured straight hair very quickly.  The retractable cord is very convenient as well as its ability to fold.  The included concentrator does a great job of drying your roots fast.  I loved this blow dryer so much, I bought my daughter one for her college dorm, and she loves it too.  Thank you Andis!|pos
excellent job very satisfied. not too much more to say no problems worked out okie dokie smoky a okay .|pos
I have naturally curly hair and this hairdryer plus the diffuser have really brought out my curls! I love it! I use the setting below the high setting and then put it on cooler air as I am finishing up. I leave it a little bit damp. My hair is never frizzy with this hairdryer. The only thing I don't like about this hair dryer is the cord. It is not very long. I would recommend this hair dryer, especially if you have curly hair and like the use the diffuser. The price is not bad as it does include 2 attachments (the diffuser and another one to localize the airflow). I would purchase this again, but another 18 inches of cord would be nice.|pos
All I can say about this hair dryer is that my wife loves it. I purchased the very same one around 5 years ago. Well, it finally died, but since it was so good, I purchased another one for my wife. She says that it works faster than others she had before, that is comfortable to hold and obviously it last for a very long time. She highly recommend it!|pos
Very handy for the grooming kit, you can wash up and dry your hair quickly without having to wait long for hair to dry|pos
My wife used one of these at a motel we stayed in. She really wanted one so I bought it.  Your old lady will dig it too because it is powerful and has a cord reel. You will hate yourself later when you have to disassemble it to dig her hair out of it because she complains about it not blowing hard like it used to. But women are like that.........blah blah blah complain blah blah.....<br />If you can disassemble this thing, clean it and re-assemble it in working order before she needs it to dry her wet head consider yourself lucky. I think a nuclear bomb would be easier to work on.|pos
I have been using the Andis Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer for years.  My first one (1600W) gave up the ghost several years ago so I replaced it with their newest model (1875W) at that time. Seeing I have had good performance with this dryer I decided to buy a back-up.|pos
I have had 2 of these for a couple of years. The one that is used by 3 people daily finally went. Bought again because its convenient and has decent power. Added a third one to my daughters room to free up the bathroom.|pos
This hair dryer was recommended to me by a hair stylist at the salon I use. It works beautifully. A little heavier than my former Conair (which lasted 10 years). My diffuser fits on it. Has a cleanable compartment for lint.|pos
The hair brush and combs fall off when you use them.The hairdryer specification say it three speed but fails to mention it only works on one speed and one heat setting if used at the 240 voltage!!!!!<br />I feel that the seller fails to mention the limitations... who buys a one speed one heat hair dryer?|neg
My sister-in-law asked for this hairdryer for Christmas. Very handy for all the travel she does. She is very happy with it.|pos
This hair dryer is small and easy to handle, but the best thing is the air flow. Many hair dryers use the word turbo in their description, but this one truly has turbo air flow. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it shining.|pos
I Love it!!!! I use it everyday. One of the best blow dryers I have purchased. My hairstyles uses it on her clients.|pos
Bought this hairdryer based on great reviews and so far it's been great. Lightweight and comes with a couple attachments for extra shine or curly hair. Get's the job done.|pos
This hair dryer works great. It has lots of power and dries super fast. A little more bulky than other travel hair dryers but since the cord retracts into the handle, it still fits in my carry bag.|pos
I haven't had a dryer with attachments since high school, but this thing is a life saver! I don't have to straighten my hair when I use the small tooth comb and it dries my hair very fast. So much of my time has been saved since I got this wonderful gadget.|pos
Great product exactly how it is described. You can't beat a Revlon blow dryer. It's also very affordable and compact.|pos
Drys quickly, not overly noisy, switches are conveniently placed (where they're not accidentally moved on/off)  The air filter can be removed for cleaning.  I use all three temperature settings, both fan speeds, and the cool-shot button.|pos
I have had the same Vidal Sassoon dryer for years.  Someone big stepped on the plug which made it unsafe to use.  I love this dryer, it's exactly what I've been using! I'm totally satisfied with the purchase....thanks for the quick delivery!|pos
I have owned this dryer previously and was looking to acquire a replacement but had wanted to shop this out sinceit is pricey for a hair dryer.  Phenomenal price and even better delivery time.|pos
THIS DRYER IS EXTREMELY HIGH POWERED. IT IS SOMEWHAT HEAVY, BUT I LOVE THE GRIP OF IT AND ITS PROBABLY SLIGHTLY HEAVY BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIGH POWERED AND FAST DRYING|pos
Bueno llego en perfecto estado y funciona muy bien ,es de buena potencia y el indicado  para relizar la el secado|pos
I bought this after reviewing every review of every hairdryer online to replace a Sharper Image hairdryer that had literally split at the seam.<br /><br />I got mine $20 cheaper on sale at Folica.com with a 2 year warranty.--On their site they rate it as the best hair dryer of 2012.<br /><br />The dryer itself is smaller than the online video reviews make it seem (youtube) and is nearly the same size as my previous travel size dryer.<br />It comes with 2 diffuser heads and a case. It seems very sturdy and yes, it has dried my hair in half the time of my previous ionic dryer.<br /><br />Note that the ionic setting emits less heat so if you need to style your hair you'll need to switch to the other position for more heat.<br /><br />I have round, straight hair, fine but thick and this dryer takes less than 5 minutes to fully dry vs. my other hair dryer I would dry for 5 minutes and walk out the door with wet hair.<br /><br />Also, worth noting that since my last haircut I hadn't been able to get it to look as good as when I walked out of the salon until I used this hair dryer! So now I'm convinced it's all about the hairdryer, forget everything else. Totally worth your money.<br /><br />If I hadn't already purchased this hairdryer I might have gone for the Solano since my hairdresser recommended that one (he also reminded me that the department store/box store dryers are not the same quality ionic dryers and you need at least 1875 watts...) but this one is nearly half the weight of the Solano and pretty darn great.|pos
I bought my hair dryer about 6 months ago.  I wasn't overly impressed with it.  It never seemed to get as hot as my previous T3 dryer and didn't smooth my hair like before.  The topper came yesterday when the dryer started sparking as I was using it leaving a nice burn on my arm.  I thought $90 for this dryer was a deal compared to stores but truth is the dryer isn't worth $9!!  Either T3 is making really cheap products or this is a knock off.  Buyer beware!!|neg
We ordered this as a Christmas gift on the recommendation of our stylist.  She spoke highly of the product and manufacturer.  However, upon opening, the dryer did not work on the High setting.  We will need to return it.|neg
It let my hair so nice and without freeze!!!!! im so sad that i drop mine by mistake after 3 years that i have it with me, but ill defenetly buy it again!!!|pos
Speedy shipment, easy ordering, sent just as described, awesome product. My teen aged daughter is loving this hair styler! Thanks!|pos
Took years for me to buy a new hairdryer and I will never wait again to do so.  This hairdryer has power, works great, on the quieter side of blow dryers and really does the job!|pos
I'm a professional hairstylist and have purchased this dryer two times. My old one broke but I use it every day all day and had it for two years. The new one seems improved from last time with a better sturdier power chord. It's super powerful and light and heats up to the perfect temp hot but not overly hot. Overall I love it and it makes my job easier!|pos
I bought this for my mum and myself for Christmas... Didn't even last until the New Year and broke after two lousy uses. Biggest waste of $250 I've ever spent|neg
Nice product with a lot of power.  I love how the cord reels up inside of the dryer for storage.  Great buy.|pos
I was optimistic about this hairdryer but a few weeks in, a rattling noise started. Then after a few months, it totally stopped blowing warm air and I'm have to replace it. Would not recommend this product. It was a total waste of money.|neg
This was my 3rd dryer in about 6 months; couldn't seem to find one with the right amount of heat and airflow.  This one is perfect.|pos
Great Product for the price. Very light  and powerful. You don't have to spend a lot of money for a good hair dryer. You won't be disappointed!|pos
I've never had a ceramic hair dryer before and I'm amazed at the quality and functionality of this one.  It provides a consistent heat and air flow.  It is heavier than other dryers I've owned and I was told that it is due to the ceramic.  This dryer is also much quieter than others I've used.  The benefits far outweigh a few ounces of extra weight.|pos
One of these is in the employee bathroom at work and I'd used it and decided I wanted one at home.  I love that it's mounted on the wall and out of the way.  Works well for what I need.|pos
I bought two dryers this is very good!! Small, compact, easy to carry on any trip! The design is beautiful and best of all: it accepts two voltages! Excellent!|pos
This hair dryer is awesome, The price is great and it has serious power on the top settings, you have to be careful not to burn your face, i have short hair and my whole head is dry in under a min on the max settings. Looks good and feels nice in your hands, not to heavy. My girlfriend loves it|pos
We are enjoying this wall mounted hair dryer very much. It was a gift but we are both enjoying it.|pos
worked just like it is supposed to really like the dryer got the job done in half the time of my old blower. Will recommend this to anyone.|pos
Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she has been using it to dry her hair ever since.  She really likes the hello kitty theme and it functions well.|pos
Works great , does what it is supposed to do which is dry hair ..  yes the outer finish starts to peal a little bit around the handle but no big deal .. its a blow dryer not a pair of shoes.  The cost was great too!|pos
This blow dryer is pretty impressive! I've had it for a few months now and am still happy with it. It dries my hair fast and leaves it smooth. It is actually better than my old $120 blow dryer! Definitely recommend!|pos
Very strong heat and durable product. I use it every day with clients and It works great! Looks good too!|pos
This blow dryer is cute, but has no air blowing power and barely heats to a warm temperature.  I gave up trying to dry my hair.|neg
Shipped and arrived within estimated time.  My husband installed it the same day and found installation very easy.  I do have to agree with others that the night light is quite bright.  I do partially close the door to our Master bath because of the light, since our bathroom is connected to our bedroom.  No complaints about using the hair dryer.  It is certainly quieter than our other one.  Would definitely purchase another.|pos
This blow dryer is lightweight and powerful.  I have thick Keratin relaxed hair and it tames my hair beautifully.  It gets very hot - which I need - and the airflow is strong.  There is a cool shot that helps with sealing in a curl or wave.  I would definitely recommend this product.|pos
A great product for a great price! I am glad I bought it. It is more than I expected. .|pos
It is a great hair dryer. My roommate use it every day and very comfortable! It is a very good choice for this price!|pos
Excelente los tiempos de entrega, la ropa llego en buen estado. buenos vendedores, Excelente el producto los recomiendo para futuras compras|pos
Bought it for my daughter for Christmas.  It was just what she wanted.  It had everything that she wanted and more.|pos
Shipment was missing a piece. It took forever for them to figure out what piece i was missing. Repeatedly asked them to overnight the missing piece because i was going out of town. Apparently they overlooked that part of the email. Hopefully they sent the right piece. This review is based on the customer service, not on whether the product works well.|neg
I love the compact, lightweight design and 3 different heat settings & cold shot. Great for a small apartment. I've been using this dryer at least once a week for the past 4 months and have had no problems so far. Attachment helps focus the air flow and is a nice addition. Only complaint so far is that the plug is a bit too smooth, so it's hard to handle when I have hair product on my hands.|pos
I bought this from Duane Reade over 4 years ago. I loved the compact design, it was perfect for my tiny apartment and the cold shot worked well. It served me well for over 4 years before the GFCI plug crapped out. A replacement plug head was more expensive than the dryer and would have required some soldering or wire splicing or something, so I gave up on it.|pos
TOTALLY RECOMENDED!! HAIR DRIES VERY FAST, I JUST GOT MINE AND IM PLEASED USING IT EVERY DAY SINCE I GOT IT|pos
This hair dryer is attractive and a good hair dryer.  My hair can sometimes be frizzy, but with this dryer, I can get it nice and smooth.  I dry it all the way and then use the cold blast for smooth hair.|pos
I bought this as a gift for my sister in law for christmas.. she hasent opened it yet so not sure how good it is yet.|pos
This did a great job.  What I loved most was how compact and easy it was to use.  I highly recommend!|pos
Got this to use on my dog who needed to be bathed almost every day.  Gets the job done quickly which is what I wanted.  Have owned it for five months and hope that it has a long life.|pos
This s the best blow dryer that I have ever used!!! Dries hair quickly and leaves a beautiful shine. Also very nice long cord which makes it easy to use.|pos
This hair dryer has Lots of power.  I liked it a lot. I would recommend it. End. Finished. Done. Bye|pos
Just what I wanted. Light weight and the switches to turn it off and on and the intensity are easy for me to use. I have MS and have a hard time with switches.|pos
This drys my hair in five minutes and I have a ton of fine hair. Much quieter than my last dryer to the point I wondered if it was working right. Works great for over a month now and easy to clean the intake on the end of dust.  Not too big to store in our vanity drawers.|pos
For about $12 you couldn't go wrong. Arrived quickly and blows hot air....what more could one want? So much better than e-bay!|pos
This hair dryer was a waste of money.<br /><br />The cord is far too short for proper styling unless you are standing within 2 feet of power socket.<br /><br />The warm setting is cool<br /><br />On the hot setting Only the inner part of the dryer blows hot hair and the outer rim is cool air which makes the hot setting basically a warm.<br /><br />Very disappointed- I would pay 15-20 for this as my local CVS.|neg
The hair dryer itself is light weight and easy to handle.  It also dries faster than the average hair dryer.  Great buy!|pos
I love it.  It's very compact and lives up to all of the product descriptions.  I would buy it again.|pos
Three heat settings, three fan settings, a truly cold &#34;cold shot&#34;, and tons of power. As my hair has been getting longer, I've been  cutting it close for work in the morning and realized it's the dang hairdryer! It took forever for me to dry my hair. I went through 2 dryers from the box store (both returned) and couldn't find 'the one.' I didn't want to spend a gazillion dollars!  So for the price, the Remington Pearl is a miracle. It's the best hairdryer I've ever used and I can get to work on time now!|pos
Put this in our bathroom at our Oceanfront rental condo, and it works great.  Nice to be able to offer guests an option instead of them having to bring their own.|pos
Pretty good for people trying to keep their hair natural without adding chemicals. Very quick and has different settings to get hair dried well.|pos
it does eactly what it says it would do! I get so many compliments on my  long hair and it takes 10 minutes!!!!|pos
I read the reviews for the many different Andis hair dryers and finally decided on this one. It is great. Dries my hair quickly without causing it to be fly-away and frizzy. Great purchase!|pos
I've had this hair dryer at least since high school-- it's been so long I can't remember, probably around 8 years.  I don't use it everyday, but it still works great!|pos
This is an amazing hair dryer for this money. Nice design, comfortable handle. It has exceeded my expectations. Love it!|pos
If you have short hair, it works well; not sure how it would work with long hair.  Easy to pack for travel|pos
Product performs as expected. All plastic housing beats the partial rubberized housing of my old Revlon dryer. The rubber on the old housing becomes extremely tacky.|pos
This is the second one I bought.  My daughter took the first one because she liked it so much.  I hope to get a lot of use from it.|pos
Product is light and powerful.  It is also very quiet.  This is a huge improvement over my last hair dryer|pos
Found this hair dryer while on business while staying at one of the Marriots.  I could not believe how fast it dried my hair, with very low heat and lots of air, not to mention how shiny it was.  So I decided to order my very own. My hair has never been easier to dry and style.....and best of all my precious dog gets his fur blown out by this hair dryer as well and his fur is dry at super speed.  What a great product and great price.  Last year i purchased one of these fancy dryers and all of a sudden it stopped blowing out hot air, what a waste....but perfect timing for this little baby.  I am hooked on this one.|pos
This dryer is perfect for the intended purpose which is an efficient, small package at a very resonable price. The air flow and heat settings are good with well marked and designed switches. The folding handle and variable voltage make it ideal for travel as well.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.|pos
Bought this dryer for taveling and for easy storage. I love this dryer and so glad I bought it. So nice.|pos
LOVE THE COOL BUTTON, WHICH HOLDS THE STYLE IN PLACE AFTER THE BRUSH IS REMOVED. MY HAIR IS STYLED MUCH BETTER DUE TO SETTINGS.....|pos
I really like this hair dryer.  Maybe it's because ours was old and no longer did the ion thing, but this one prevents frizz and dries hair very quickly.  And its not huge.  It's a normal size in my opinion, smaller than many in the market.  Could not ask for more in a hair dryer.|pos
Great dryer with good fan speeds.  Quieter than most without hurting your ears with high pitched noise.  The cool down button lets you customize your heat. Folds up for easy packing. We own 4 of these as they will probably quit making them for something of less quality soon.|pos
I didn't realize how close to death my old dryer had gotten until this one arrived. It dries my hair much more quickly and although it isn't quiet it's a much more tolerable noise than the whine my old one had developed. It is a bit heavy, but I like that...makes it feel sturdy and well made. The finish is nice too...kind of velvety. I definitely recommend this dryer!|pos
Wife uses it daily....says it is much quieter and lighter than previous versions, and does a great job and it easy to use...would recommend buying this item!!!|pos
Don't hesitate, it works perfectly. Very fast.  .  .  .  .  .  .. .. . . . . . .|pos
Dries my hair really fast!  Love the product and would highly recommend.  My daughter loved it also.  Product received on time.|pos
excelente muy buena calidad es preciosa a mi hija le gusto mucho y soy de venezuela y todo fue rapido|pos
I have one in my guest bathroom and my visitors can use it. You dont have to looking one in the lower of the lavatory.|pos
It blows... it blows hot air... its uses that hot air to dry your hair. I dont have much hair, but what I do have gets dried. Seriously I dont know what else to say. If i was a woman with a ton of hair then I'd say invest in a better hair dryer. This one seems &#34;sufficient&#34; but thats it.|pos
This is my second of the same model.  Previous one was used every day for over 5 years - exceptional value for money.|pos
Dries hair really fast as it has good volume of air and the air temperature is just right. Only problem is that it works for 110 V AC (US domestic voltage) only.|pos
YO COMPRE ESTO PARA MI HIJA Y LE ENCANTO LE SALVA MUCHO TIEMPO Y DINERO CADA VES QUE ELLA QUIERE HACERCE EL PELO|pos
I replaced my old one with this dryer. My daughter has one like it and I love the amount of air produced. I have long, thick hair and drying it is a snap with this dryer.|pos
I bought this because it was cute and other 1875 watt dryers seemed to do the trick before. This is just awful if you have thick hair. It is very weak and I can hear things popping inside.|neg
It 's a nice dryer.  It works well.  I don't really use any of the special features, although it has the 3 heat settings and 1 cooling setting.  I just dry my hair.|pos
It works as I desired, without blowing my hair with a blast.  It is a gentle air for fine hair.|pos
my wife loves it and the night light is very nice.  she uses it every day and finds it really works good|pos
It works fast, quietly and better than much higher priced hair dryers. I love the shine it leaves with minimal effort and time.|pos
I really love this hair dryer. My hair always looks nice and smooth and silky after using it and it dries my thick hair really fast.|pos
My hair has come out fantastic every time with this. The attachments are great. The only thing is that the attachments are hard to get on...but it works. Love it and highly recommend.|pos
I had the same hair dryer for about six years, then it gave up.  I really didn't want to have to find another kind and change the mounting bracket, etc.  So I ordered the same model number and the bracket was still the same!  Yeah!  I was able to change it out myself!|pos
I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment. It clicks in no problem (as well as the concentrator but I've only used it once) and you can easily take it off. The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom, it helps. It also has a hook on the base of the handle, you can kind of see it in the picture, which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up. I use it on the hot heat, low setting and I don't see a lot of frizz even without product. It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy. But if you use it on the high setting, it gets noisy. Overall, I love this dryer. So far. I'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer.|pos
Everytime i take it of by bag at the gym, girls start laughing, but when they see me using it and the results, they ask me where i got it...I very proud of my purchase! :D|pos
Such a great tool! It makes hair drying much faster, and my hair never stays curly. It drys almost all straight.|pos
If you are looking for a lightweight dryer that doesn't create hurricane force winds this is the one. My hair is short/medium length and fine. I don't need a mega dryer that sound like an aircraft. This is a compact little thing that fits the bill. It is also a tad quieter than the typical 1875 watt dryer. Two settings high(hot) and low (warm)work great for creating a curl/wave with a round brush. Would recommend for short to medium length fine hair.|pos
I have very frizzy hair, but after i wash my hair and use this to dry it up it makes my hair soft and smooth.<br />I would recommend this dryer to my friends.|pos
I was looking for an affordable hair dryer and picked this one based on other reviews, and its worked great for me.<br />You can change the settings enough to get any kind of speed or temperature, and since you can fold the handle it's easy to store in a small bathroom drawer.<br />The retractable cord is a plus too, and it doesn't get all tangled up with your other junk. No complaints!|pos
Really nice  Hair dryer. Is for a gift and I'm sure she will love it. I like the way the handle folds.|pos
ship very fast,stuff is good!~I like it!~good styff ,I love it ,very nice good !~good good good !~very good !|pos
I bought my first T3 for the weight, noise, and ionic benefits.  I had a T3 for years and loved the performance.  However the construction was shabby from day one. The nozzle would not stay in place. I ended up taping it on.  When it finally died, I replaced it with another T3 thinking the first one was a lemon. This last one also disappointed.  The first time I tried to replace the concentrator, it bent the dryer!<br /><br />Plus this one seemed to leave my hair fuzzy - NO benefits from ionic ceramic claims.  This one is in a drawer and I use the Revlon I bought for 1/3 the price.|neg
Upon first use, this item did not blow hot air. On the low flow airflow setting, it blew vaguely warm. On the high airflow setting, it blew cold.<br /><br />When set to low heat, it didn't even pretend.|neg
Had a good experience with this order, it took about 7 business days to arrive.  And have been using this product for years.|pos
Great hair dryer . Wife loves the retractable cord and compact size. After using the hair dryer for about a year, the cord broke inside causing the dryer to shut on and off.  The warranty is about useless because after paying all the shipping costs both ways, it costs as much as buying a new one.|pos
For the price, this is a pretty nice dryer. I almost never use the low setting on hair dryers regardless, but I tested it just to see, and it's not quite hot enough to give me the oomph I need to dry my hair. So there's that. The cold shot seems to suck up a lot of power, and I don't use it any more for fear of blowing a circuit breaker, but considering how much I paid for it, this does its job and it does it pretty well.|pos
Shipped fast. This dryer dries my thick long hair quite a bit qucker than the dryer it replaced. I also really like that the cord is extra long.  I don't plan to use the attachmens so I cannot comment on those.|pos
I like this drying in many ways. It is lightweight, it is powerful, has a great retractable cord and that is a huge plus! I hope it lasts a long time.|pos
Easy to use, very handy, always at your disposal.  It isn't a powerful dryer, but it works great on mens hair.  The wall mount is simple to install, and it's shock protected.  Great value|pos
Bright nightlight, light weight, excellent heat and air for such a compact hair dryer.  A must have, space saver and reasonable price.|pos
My wife loves this hair dryer. It produces very warm air with tremendous air flow. I will say it took 2 months for it to finally come from the time I originally ordered it.|pos
I don't need any special hair tools that cost $100. I have thick, wavy hair and this works just fine, especially with the diffuser attachment. I love how the cord retracts and the handle folds up - it makes storing it wonderfully easy. I would recommend this to anyone.|pos
I was excited about the hair dryer and used it less than two weeks and the high speed just quit. High speed is what I use to dry my hair so now the dryer is useless to me. I have never had this happen. I purchased the hair dryer because it came highly rated.|neg
Purchased this product from Amazon more than a year ago and have had no issues with it all. Great purchase!|pos
The Infiniti by Conair Mighty Mini Tourmaline Ceramic Styler has traveled to many countries with me thanks to the ability to change voltage and is my favorite travel hair dryer.  I'm amazed at how powerful the hair dryer is for such a small product.  It's very light weight, small, and the carrying case easily slips into a carry on or packed luggage.  The attachments (though I never use them) are a nice addition as well.  I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  I haven't had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  It's really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.  I have had several other mini dryers (both by Connair and by Revlon) but this is by far my favorite.  I've had it for four years and I hope to be able to use it for many more years to come! I always recommend it to my students on study abroad programs and to friends who do a lot of traveling!|pos
I love this little blow dryer.  I use it to warm up my bed when it is cold at night.  (before I go to sleep)  I dont use it to blow dry my hair so I dont know about how it would work for that, but it works great for my purposes.|pos
Excelent product and quick delivery!! If you want a professional hair dryer, this is used by stylists here. Thank  you from Dominican Republic! Excelente producto y entrega r&aacute;pida! Si desea un secador de pelo profesional, este es el que utilizan las estilistas aqu&iacute;. Gracias desde Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana!|pos
It is easy to use. My sister had the same brand hair dryer well the same just different color. I would never learn how to blow out my hair in a million years, it'll be three times as puffy and frizzy after I'm done with it. After using this product with the comb i instantly fell for it. Thanks to my sis and ofourse Andis hair dryer I love and an finally manage my hair, most importantly I save a lot of time getting ready in the morning. I guess its great quality for its price. I would recommend it. Actually I did and my cousin bought the same one after using mines.|pos
I had this model blow dryer for over 7 years until I dropped it and broke the fan. This blow dryer took many years of abuse and worked like a champ. I bought the same model to replace the one I had.|pos
None available.|neg
The best I have ever used.  I used it ata friend's house while away for the weekend and knew I had to buy one.  My daughters love it too.|pos
My old Conair hair dryer finally smoked--it owed me nothing after many years of great service--and I couldn't find anything in the stores that measured up. Found this one online and so far, it's great. I love that it has options. 4 heat settings and 3 speeds with a cold shot feature and independent controls for many drying combinations. It was the only one I found like it. While the speed isn't as fast and the heat isn't quite as hot as the old one, it still does the job well and my hair will probably be happier for it! After returning one that felt awkward and top heavy, I like that this one feels light and balanced. I don't have need for the 2 attachments but they seem good quality. Hoping it lasts as long as it's predecessor!|pos
Very good product. Lightweight and compact, but powerful. Came quickly and was well packaged.Easy to use and place out of sight.|pos
This blowdryer is amazing. My sylist uses it in my hair and I had to buy it for my home. It works for me and my daughter with ease. A must buy.|pos
After 18 years, I found myself looking for a new hair dryer.  I had been interested in the 'ions' I'd seen on many packages.  This is a very nice hair dryer, it came with both a diffuser and a concentrator which snap on nicely and work well, as designed.  It dries my hair very quickly even on the low setting, and I like how the intake is on the back rather than the sides and is less likely to draw longer hair into it.  Supposedly, you can remove that part for cleaning, but I haven't figured out how.<br /><br />Overall, a really awesome product, especially for the price.|pos
I'm a hairdresser. I bought this dryer thinking it would last and it broke after only 7 months!!! It was great while it lasted! Now I have to buy a whole new dryer since FHI won't fix it because I purchased it through amazon!|neg
I love this blow dryer. Its ionic which is the best type of blow dryer for your hair and it really does make hair smoother and softer. It very stylish looking and easy to hold. It works great every time I use it and only takes about 40 minutes to dry my hair. The heat flow is very strong and I also like the cool shot as well. It very chilly. lol|pos
Nice, easy, portable hand dryer that is available in fun colors.  I use this product with an attachable hood dryer to deep condition my hair.  Very convenient and the retractable cord makes it easy to store without the hassle of dealing with a messy cord.|pos
This Hair Dryer is PERFECT!! Love it!!! Small but, Powerful! I have very thick hair & it dryes it fast. Exactly what I was looking for.|pos
I ordered this dryer for my sister and she loved it, it was exactly as the page and picture described|pos
drys your hair very quickly with a smooth shine,  so glad I bought it., will fit into a small corner of my luggage, so very handy.|pos
I love this hair dryer!  It dries my hair in half the time and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  I can't believe the great price - I had been looking at it in a local store for $250!!  Glad I didn't spring for that!  It is also much quieter than other hair dryers.  Don't hesitate to buy this - you won't regret it.|pos
my wife had this itme before for more than 10 years and she sed that she love the way it works for all this time that she used this item. she ask me to buy this one because the other one it burns the extension cord actually the plug of the extension and this one have a reset and a power control on the plug so it might be better than the other one and it doesnt get to hot like the old ones|pos
I ordered this hairdryer July 2nd and it quit working on December 2nd lasting just at 5 months. I tried hitting the reset thinking that somehow it had been tripped although I was using the dryer when it quit. I also let it cool off and tried again, all with no success.  I used this dryer every day to dry my medium length hair and it was the shortest lived dryer I've had in several years. All the other cheap dryers lasted at least a year or a little longer. I don't know whether placement of the switches to turn the dryer on and off and to change the temperature had anything to do with the short lifespan or not. I was constantly accidentally turning the dryer off & changing the temperature while drying due to this placement. I will never order a dryer made by Andis again. This was definitely not worth the money I paid for it.|neg
I love everything about this hair dryer, so I am glad I ordered it.  It is lightweight and does a great job.|pos
I bought this dryer to use on my 8 month old puppy because it was supposed to be quiet. It's not real quiet, but then it is blowing air. My dog was a little shy of it at first. But taking time to introduce him to it slowly worked fine. He now looks forward to being blow dried after his bath and when we come in out of the rain or snow. It seems well made. I will have to see how long it lasts.|pos
No complaints. I have very thick hair and this hairdryer dries it very quickly. The settings are great. The cord is wonderful. The price is awesome.|pos
Conair makes great hair dryers, and this in no exception. Relatively quiet, and generates sufficient heat to satisfy most customers.|pos
This hair dryer make and model is a replacement  of a product that I have been using for several years.  This dryer is great to hang on the wall, saving space on the countertops.|pos
I like it... it is very easy to use and to handle it is also very practical if you want to take it for travel ... My hair gets dry very quick I was surprise with the power of this dryer I thought it might be too low, but not.  yes buy it  is a good product and cheap ...one year warranty ..|pos
Fantastic dryer night light is great for kids and two speed is awsome!! Will buy another one of these next time!!|pos
Great price, lightweight, long cord which makes drying my hair and shifting the dryer from hand to hand so much easier, not as noisy as my last hair dryer, and it does dry my thick medium length hair faster than my past hair dryers. I am able to switch from warm to hot and high, off, low without having to look at the dryer.  I really do love this hair dryer!!|pos
I had the exact dryer prior to purchasing this one.  I had it for many years before it gave out.  I have thick, curly hair and this gets it dry in no time.  Its light weight and easy to hold.  It has 3 different heat settings and high/low setting for air flow.  Very happy with this product.|pos
Ingenious product. Simple and convenient. I glued it to my mirror and stayed there. No more trouble holding the dryer on one hand and brushing my hair with the other one! worth every penny|pos
This is an awesome hair dryer - I never really thought there was much difference between the various kinds until now! My hair, which is thick, drys super quick and this dryer eliminates all the frizz - amazing :)|pos
Gives great volume with exceptional heat control!  Would recommend to anyone looking to enhance body and volume with their hair.|pos
Love this hair dryer!  Purchased this model after seeing the Good Housekeeping reviews.  Lightweight, the right amount of power to style my hair just right, nice extra features like the cool shot button and the extra long, flexible cord, and all at a reasonable price.  Would definitely recommend this product.|pos
A hotel I stayed at had this model. Loved it so much came home from my trip and ordered it. Dries my hair quickly and small enough that it doesn't take up too much counter space in my bathroom.|pos
I bought this dryer to replace one I use at home.  It is a good hair dryer but only has one heat setting.  I love the way it folds up for storage and the cord retracts which is nice.  These 2 features alone make it great for travel!|pos
It's just as advertised.  Dries my hair quickly, folds up nicely and neatly. The retractable cord is great. It's a good purchase.|pos
My wife loves this hair dryer. Its easy to use; drys and curls her hair nicely. Just make sure your hair is damp not real wet before putting it in rollers. Other wise your hair really won't dry or curl. The hair dryer will work better and you will have a full head of curley hair.|pos
For years, I've used Conair 1875s for both our primary blow dryer (yes, my wife has long hair) and our travel needs (motorcycle touring means limited luggage space). The dryer produces a high volume of heated air for rapid drying. Its wattage draw is low enough that tripping circuit breakers is never an issue. Durability is good - our's usually last at least five years with daily use by two people. The current iteration of this model uses a shorter cord and a bulkier plug/GFI than earlier models. While I prefer the original configuration (longer cord with smaller plug/GFI), the changes have not seriously compromised the product.|pos
I am thrilled with this hair dryer.  It is better than even I imagined.  Looked at several at the local beauty supply houses... all with huge price tags.  I am so happy with this one, I can't begin to explain.  My hair is not fly-away like it is with my old dryer.  It has plenty of volume and is sleek and shiny.  I can't believe it took me so long to buy such a quality dryer.  I recommend this highly!|pos
I love this hair dryer.  I bought the travel size and a local Ulta.  I immediately loved it.  Drys my hair fast and doesn't fry it. Would recommend it.|pos
It is very potent and haven't given me any problem so far.<br />I paid $3 and something plus shipping, so it was very cheap and I think it's a good quality product.<br />OK, it might not be the best hairdryer out there (it is not made of ceramic and has no ion-thingy to keep your hair from splitting and things like that), but it was just what I needed. I would buy it again (for that price).|pos
This dryer is absolutely awesome. The heat settings are exactly what I needed, and the force and speeds are great for volume and fast drying. Really worth the price.|pos
I love this hair dryer.  It is very quiet, the retractable cord works well, and it has a cold setting as well as a cold button. It feels solid and is easy to handle.  It's everything I was looking for in a dryer and at a very reasonable price.|pos
I just love my new hair dryer and gets my hair nice and straight without getting to hot. It comes with two attachments and is priced right for me.|pos
Really works well.  One if the best hair dryers I have owned.  Definitely a great deal since they are $300.00 retail|pos
One of the best reasonably priced dryers out there. My old one made my hair frizzy and dried out, I am so pleased with my results!|pos
I have ordered several of these dryers and have been happy with them all.  I run a salon and enjoy retailing these dryers to my clients|pos
I had a previous similar model for many years and needed repl, this one is great! best price on net.|pos
I ordered this because it was cheaper than Sallies sold it for. I actually have this product and it has been the best hair dryer I've ever owned, so I ordered a new one for my mom as a gift. It came in the exact packaging and I couldn't be happier. Now my mom can stop stealing my hair dryer!|pos
I got this for a trip that I was taking and didn't want to take my bulky dryer.  This one is lightweight, has good power selectiion and temperature control settings.  I'm very happy with Conair products|pos
After 8 years with my old hair dryer. It was time for a new one.<br />This dryer had more option than my old one.<br />And it cut my drying time in half.|pos
Good speed and heat options. I like that the hair dryer is pretty small. My other one was huge and awkward to maneuver. The concentrator attachment is good. Every hair dryer needs one. The diffuser is scary haha! I have no idea what to do with it but whatever. It is apparently for creating volume, but I have thick, short asian hair so I don't need any extra volume. Cord length is fine. The back opens up really easily for cleaning. The cool button and cool heat function are ACTUALLY cool. Most hairdryers take time to cool down, so going from hot to cold doesn't work. However, on this hairdryer, if you want to go straight from hot to cool, it happens in seconds. maybe it's just because it has cooled down here in san diego but I can't really definitively determine that. Anyways great hairdryer! :)|pos
THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, I ALSO USE IT FOR STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR BECAUSE IT CAME WITH ATTACHMENTS.<br />MY HAIR WAS DRY WITH IN 5MINUTES, THE PRICE WAS ALSO GOOD AND IT CAME WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY.|pos
Great lightweight dryer. Dries hair fast and is so quiet you can actually hear your client talking to you, even in a busy salon.|pos
A replacement for another Conair, this one is the best. There are cheaper models, but this one is very well made and we have every reason to expect the longevity other reviewers have noted. I use the low setting (I used to use high on my old one) and it works beautifully and is much quieter. The cord retractor is great; at first I expected this to be just a marketing gimmick, but now I wouldn't buy a dryer without one. Very nice to pull the cord in and drop the dryer in a drawer without having to roll up the cord first, and then untangle it whenever you take it out. We ended up buying two of these to prevent my daughter from swiping it and having to search. Nice to find a product that is well made and reasonably priced. This is not a cheap throw-away, it is a good value.|pos
The off-on switch on my old Conair travel dryer broke after 5-6 years, so I purchased this one after reading reviews. It's even more compact than the old one, and I was pleased to find that it came with a 6' cord, unlike the old dryer that had a curly cord that wouldn't stretch far. It dries my hair in about 3 minutes, and the long cord and two heat settings make it ideal for drying my dogs after bathing, too. The only thing missing is a case for the hair dryer. The old Conair came with one and I saved it - the new one fits perfectly.|pos
This is the best $35 investment that I could have possibly made for my hair.  I have thick, coarse, curly-ish with a semblance of a wave hair so blow-drying it can be quite a challenge.  This hair dryer gets my hair very straight in no time.|pos
I purchased this mainly for the retractable cord because my storage space is limited. The cord does not retract well and when it does still leaves about a foot hanging out. Even has a stopper (if it reaches it) that leaves about 8 inches out. I didn't even try to plug it in. Love Amazons return policy.....|neg
The product works as advertised and actually dries my hair in less than half the time as my other hair dryer with much less heat!  I almost didn't believe it was possible until using this unit.  The only problem is the color of the unit is not the same as what's here or even on the box.  I was expecting red.  It's not.  It's a metallic hot pink.  Definitely something difficult for a man to pull off unless you're married and can claim it belongs to your wife.|pos
This hairdryer has a serious design flaw. There is no &#34;guard&#34; preventing hair from being pulled into the fan and ripped from the scalp. It is especially hazardous to those who have fine hair that tends to have flyaways. I should have returned it immediately but I decided to continue using it with caution. Mistake! This morning a large clump of my hair was pulled into the fan and subsequently torn out! Needless to say, I am quite unhappy about it. I will be contacting the manufacturer.|neg
I purchased this hair dryer because I used one in a hotel I was staying at and liked it.  I also took into consideration that I have limited space in which to hang it and it was perfect.|pos
This was exactly as advertised; I especially liked the dimensions given. Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to switch the lever behind the lint filter to get full power.|pos
Perfect size for travel. It works better than any hotel wall mounted blower I've tried---It is quite powerful for its size---not like a regular size blower of course. Over all I am very pleased|pos
I'm a hairstylist and this was recommended by a couple of coworkers. It recently arrived, but I've used it on a number of clients already and it's great. Strong airflow, high heat, lightweight, cool shot button, and works very well with my diffuser attachment also.  Makes my job much easier!|pos
It's powerful and with high efficiency. Just hope that it can continue working well for me for a longer time (at least more than 6 months.)  :D<br />By the way, delivery is also fast.|pos
Usually I buy Conair hair dryers but chose the Andis and it is more powerfull than the Conair even though they are 1875 Watt.  I have not used the attachments because I have short, straight, thick hair that I blow dry and it just falls into place requiring little brushing.  I do believe it is just a bit heavier than the Conair dryer but not so much that causes me a problem.  I am so glad I chose the Andis instead of another Conair.  It was packaged very well and arrived two days after I placed my order.  I would be glad to recommend this Andis 82005 to my family and friends.|pos
I bought this dryer thinking it was going to revolutionize my morning ritual. Yeah, I was wrong. It dried my hair slower than any other hair dryer I have ever had and left my hair frizzy every. single. time. Then it died not 6 months after I got it, which was actually a total relief because I ended up spending $30 on the best dryer I've ever had, the orange Conair Infiniti Pro. Save your money & check out that one instead, you won't be disappointed.|neg
Delivered on time. This is the only dryer my wife likes. She uses it everyday.|pos
This blow dryer is great.  It blow dries my hair in about half the time of my old blow dryer.  It also helps tame my frizzy hair.  Love it.|pos
I bought this for travel purposes and it has exceeded my expectations. When folded up, this hair dryer fits in the smallest places and isn't bulky at all. This portable hair dryer is pretty strong and dries my hair just as quickly as any other large dryer I have ever tried. The only criticism I have for this product would be how loud it is.|pos
Love this hairdryer ..... its one of the best around ...... drying time is so much less and it doesn't fry your hair as many others have.<br />I would buy it again.|pos
This is a great hairdryer.  I am thrilled with this purchase.  I would recommend this hairdryer to anyone.  It dries my hair very quickly.|pos
Shipped quickly and works wonderfully. Nice hot dryer to get the job done in no time. You will not be sorry!|pos
I purchased this hairdryer four months ago, and the heating element has already broken. I generally fold it up when I store it, and one day while I was opening it to use it I heard a strange metallic pop. Apparently, that was the heating element breaking. It's now pretty useless; it will only blow cold air (just in time for winter, I might add).<br /><br />As an aside, this is the second Revlon hairdryer I've bought this year after having a hairdryer of another brand for a few years. I'm beginning to think that the brand itself is not reliable--or at least the lower end ones aren't.|neg
This little beauty has great heat and blowing capacity.  I love it and use it at home and when traveling.  I like the small size and light weight.  It's amazing that they packed 1600 Watts into this tiny little blower.  You'll love the power it has. I have since bought two for others as gifts.|pos
I had another T3 that died after years of use. I received my new drier expeditiously and don't want to be without it. Great service and great product.|pos
Great! Quiet, quick, pretty. Lots of setting options. Dries much quicker than my other dryer.  Less frizz too. Definitely my favorite dryer I've had. More professional. Also shipped quickly. I'd recommend.|pos
If you are looking for a great dryer for both home and travel...This is it! I am more than satisfied with this product. In fact, I will be ordering another one because I do not want to be without it. The shipping was faster than expected and it was packaged well.|pos
I can not say enough good things about this hair dryer. I have long curly hair that took over an hour to dry. Now I can actually leave for work on time. My previous dryer was more expensive and not even close to being as good or as fast. No reason to ever spend more money again. I am a very satified customer. Without a doubt, I will be a repeat customer next time I need a new hair dryer.|pos
BE WARNED ---- Don't buy unless you want a fire on your hands. IF YOU HAVE ONE THROW IT AWAY!!! This product exploded in my hands just as I plugged it in and I have only had it for a few weeks.  If you read other reviews on this you will see that this is not the first or second time that this has happened and the supplier is refusing to refund.  Totally shabby treatment all around!!!! AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE IT FROM THEIR SITE!!! [[ASIN:B000M7YQOM Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer]]|neg
Nice size for storage. Dryer came ready to use, and the cool switch is great as last stage to dry. It would be nice to have a hanger loop.|pos
It did not work in Europe. Every hotel in the US has a hair dryer. Why would I carry this with me? However we need it in Europe when we travel. Garbage!|neg
Fast and helpful used them before would use them again I choose them over my pro distributer that all folks|pos
This hairdryer started a fire in my home 3 weeks ago. It was left plugged in but not left on. It did not overheat. I did notice that it hesitated to turn on for a half second before we used it for the last time. I set it down on a table and left for the day. When I returned a few hours later, it had melted into an unrecognizable puddle. Burned the table and the floor beneath it. The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself.  Please make sure to unplug your hairdryers after use!!!!|neg
love this blow dryer - cool with retractable cord and small that fits when you travel! perfect size, weight and great air quality. drys hair quickly.|pos
Like others that have reviewed, I had used this hair dryer at the Cosmpolitan Hotel in Vegas.<br />Took a photo with my phone so I could order one when I got home.<br />I have lots of hair and it does a great job and has the benefit<br />of folding and retractable cord.|pos
I love the Infinity Conair hairdryer.  I especially like that it has the ceramic heater since it doesn't get hot enough to burn my 2 year old great granddaugher when she is in the the bathroom with me.  The Cord Reel works great.|pos
Pros:<br />-Quiet<br />  I usually wear earplugs when drying my hair, but no more! This one's nice and quiet<br />-Fast<br />  Some people mistake quiet for less power, but this is not true.  This dryer dries my hair in half the time of my old noisy one, and I can tell by how much it blows my hair around that it is powerful.<br />-Less frizz<br />  This does not mean NO frizz, sadly, but my hair gets VERY frizzy when dried with a hair dryer, and with this hair dryer, the frizziness was about half as much - a vast improvement!<br />-Compact<br />  Folds up and fits in our little drawer!<br /><br />I don't really see any cons with this product. The cord is not very long, but I find that to be a pro because it doesn't get tangled.  After all, how far from the outlet do I really need to go?|pos
I initially ordered the Solano 3500. Though it look sturdy and well made, my Conair 207P Infinity Tourmaline Ceramic Hair Dryer dries my hair way faster than the Solano 3500. I was going to exchange it with the Solano 3700 but it wasn't on sale and I don't want to pay $200 dollars for a hair dryer. I was hesitant to try the Sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but I thought worst case scenario I can return it if I end up not liking it. Sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer. It look sturdy , has a sleek look and weighs 1.2 lbs, weighed not including the cord. Hair dryer's length is 5 3/4 inches ( without the concentrator ) , depth 2 3/4 inches, height ( from top of the dryer to the bottom of the handle ) 7 3/4 inches. Solano 3500 though much bigger than Sedu 4000i just weigh 1 pound. First time I used the Sedu 4000i I was so impressed. It dried my hair way faster ( took only 10 minutes ) than my 4 yr old Conair that burns my hair sometimes. I have long ( mid back ) hair. Medium thickness with some wave and I don't like to use flat iron or any kind of hair products on my hair. ( except shampoo and conditioner ). Sedu is also quieter than my old Conair and Solano 3500. With Sedu 4000i my hair looks so shiny, straight and frizz-free. I keep the ion switch off on my hair dryer because I want some body/volume on my hair. I so love my hair dryer that I am always looking forward to use it. Very highly recommended.|pos
ONE STAR IS TOO HIGH......while I've used Yellow Bird Hair Dryers for years and have always loved them, their high quality has totally deteriorated.  The last two hair dryers have worked less than 2 months.  The first time it happened, I decided to give them a 2nd chance.  Now, this hair dryers has quit heating after only one month of use.<br /><br />Returning the item is expensive and time consuming......I'll just have to find another company and hair dryer.  Surely, there are others that will work for longer than 1-2 months.|neg
I purchased this hair dryer for my wife who happens to be a professional hair stylist, and I would say that she is very selective (picky) about the products she uses. For her work, similar hair dryers sell for almost $200. Consequently, I thought this was a very good buy. At any rate, so far she loves this product. She uses it at home and has nothing but compliments about the dryer. She even suggested that we should buy one for each of our two daughters for Christmas. So far, a very happy customer!|pos
I chose this because i like this product and because it was a great price! I would recommend this to anyone interested in this product! Blow dryer is awesome and works very well|pos
I love this in my kids bathroom because its something they actually put up! It's working great! Our last one only lasted about a year, so hopefully this one will last longer|pos
brilliant product, excellent delivery service, love the finish of the haridrier, I didn't realised that it was American plug so I've purchased an adaptor from amazon and all sorted! :)|pos
This looked like a good hairdryer when I unpacked it, but the hose will not stay attached to the bonnet and if you hold it by hand, the hot air never gets to the front and top of the bonnet.  It's basically useless.|neg
It is in good quality and convenient to use. I am highly recommended this product. And I love the product!|pos
I replaced this unit after 15 years with the same model.  Works great, just need to clean fan area occassionally.|pos
I have used my Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord for at least three times a week since I got it, but it has been only about a month since it arrived!  That is not a long time to evaluate it thoroughly, but it has been excellent so far.  Due to the retractable cord feature the barrel is a little fatter than other hair dryers that I have tried, but so far it is better than any other dryer I have used!  I think that if you use reasonable care when retracting the cord (like running the cord through your fingers as it retracts, to slow it down and straighten out any twists), it should last a long time.  I think that letting the cord zoom up at full speed, like I have inadvertently done twice, might shorten the Cord Retraction devices life (as some reviewers have reported).  I do not think that will be a problem though, if you use reasonable care and let the cord retract through your fingers.  The ionizer feature appears to really help make the hair easier to manage, too!|pos
I recently was medically retired from the military. As part of my transition to the civilian world, I have decided to grow out my hair because, in my mind, I believe I will one day look as stylish and sexy as Leonardo Decaprio. I am finding, though, that to achieve that look there is a lot involved including blow drying your hair. Not just for style but functionality as walking around all morning with wet hair is not fun.<br /><br />This ceramic hair dryer is amazing. It folds up saving space which is great since I am an organized O.C.D. son of a gun after so many years in the military. To add to the storage technique the cord conveniently retracts back into the main body of the blow dryer.<br /><br />This means that I can use the hair dryer both at the home and on the road as I do travel quite  a bit and find the hair dryers that come free in many hotel rooms leaving a lot to be desired.<br /><br />For its size, this hair dryer is also very powerful. I was surprised at both the amount of air it is able to blow as well as how hot it is capable of getting. It comes with a cool blast button which circulates regular room air. I use this setting when blowing hair off my neck after shaving it or after cutting my children's hair.<br /><br />Probably one of the biggest selling points, since I am a man, is the stylish grey/silver/black colors that feel manly in my hand versus the lime green and hot pink blow dryer my wife tried to get me to use the other morning.<br /><br />Overall, a very attractive and functional hair dryer that also has durability on its side. A great investment.|pos
I have long hair, it goes just past my mid back, and I blow dry my hair almost every day. So as you can imagine a good hair dryer is very important to me. Although I only got the hair dryer yesterday after using it this morning I had to post a review. This is the best hair dryer I have had in a long time. It has a lot of power and my hair was completely dry in about 10 mins +/-. Considering how much hair I have this is FAST. The dryer itself is not too heavy and is quieter than most models. My hair was so soft, straight and shiny after using this hair dryer I must say I am instantly in love.|pos
We had one of these for years, replaced it with a different design, but returned to this one because it's just a superior design.<br /><br />Easy to unlatch and latch securely to the wall mount. Excellent performance in drying hair.<br /><br />I should have ordered two just in case they stop making this design type... hard to find.|pos
I have owned this dryer for two and a half years and it still work perfectly.<br /><br />All dryers seem to be the same with a fan, a heating element a stay cool body and some controls. This one has a powerful heating element (1875 watts), and a good fan (for its size). The purpose of a hair dryer is not to heat up the hair to boil away the water, but to speed up the evaporation process of drying by exposing the hair to a stream of hot air. The faster the stream and the warmer the air, the more evaporation occurs.  Where this dryer differs is in the body that has a longer and narrower nozzle that is about one inch wide. This forces a much stronger blast of air (at least on high speed) that is not a wide as those dryers with a wide nozzle.<br /><br />If your hair is fine, colored, permed or naturally curly, you would want a different dryer with a wider nozzle to diffuse the heat so that the hair dries more slowly at a cooler temperature. That may make the hair less likely to frizz and it may give the hair more volume.<br /><br />This dryer makes the nozzle narrow and thus helps to concentrate the heat into one spot in order to make the hair it blows on dry rapidly. You can adjust the fan speed and the temperature, but not the concentration of the air flow.<br /><br />So, if you have regular hair or (like me) are a guy that just wants to dry their hair rapidly, this is the dryer for you. Put it on high speed and high heat and it is extremely fast.|pos
I have fine, relatively straight, long hair. I bought this hair dryer a year ago, thinking that it would last for a while. I use it every other day to dry my hair. Nothing unusual.  It worked as described for almost a year and suddenly the plastic covering the shaft started to melt down. It still works but I'm not sure if its still safe to use it. Just consider another product if you are ready to spend this kind of money.|neg
I saw this in a hotel I was staying in and came home and ordered! Takes a mess off the counter and works like a pro. Turns my bathroom into that hotel feel every morning!|pos
I can not tell you how amazing this blow dryer is!  A great price too!  A must have for every woman!|pos
As usual most of items here I buy for my wife))) She likes this hair dryer! It has cold, warm and hot regime, concentrator and diffuser that helps her to stylish her hair in different ways. It's very comfortable to hand it. We are thinking about Remington flat iron now ;)|pos
Do not  buy this Hair dryer! Mine caught fire when it was plugged in  but not turned on. If I had not been home it  would have burned down my house! As it was, I smelled smoke and  was able to put out the fire! Very scary ! I was  lucky I did not get burned and nothing was damaged. I will never buy another Conair product again!<br />C.|neg
Straight forward, strong hot heat. I'm a guy and this thing is the simple hot strong wind I wanted. Simple High and Low setting. That's all.|pos
My husband has been using a hair dryer with broken teeth off the comb for what seems like forever.  When he mentioned it, I immediately went to Amazon, found just the right hair dryer and it works perfectly.  It has just the right heat and accessories for both of us.  I would suggest to others to buy this  one.|pos
Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.|neg
Very light weight, and is not too hot on hair, gets the job done! Very happy with this hair dryer!|pos
This hair dryer is without a doubt the best I have ever purchased. It is light, easy to handle, and leaves my hair soft and silky. Will dry hair very quickly, eliminating flyaways and frizz. Great tool for the price.|pos
My wife has been using this hair dryer for about a year now with no problems until today, when the dryer motor exploded in her hands and she was nearly electrocuted when she tried to unplug it. Reading some of the other reviews, I see that she was very lucky - the casing remained intact and the tiny sharp pieces of the motor remained inside the unit rather than turning into dangerous shrapnel. The Andis 82075 Tourmaline/Ionic Hair Dryer is a poorly-designed, dangerous product that should be taken off the market.|neg
I was very disappointed in this product. Australian power outlets are different to this product. I was able to return it for a refund but the cost to repost it was more than triple the cost of the product. I was only being re embersed for a minimal amount. Where is the product?? on the rubbish shelf in the shed. Would not purchase again.|neg
I like this dryer.  It's pretty loud as far as hair dryers go and I like that it has three different heat levels but I find that warm isn't warm enough but hot is pretty darn hot.  So hot I can't use it when I dry my childrens' hair.  I use it myself but worry that much heat could be damaging my hair.  Cool shot works well and it's a good weight for a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER:  I have had this hair dryer for almost 2 years and I always noticed that the handle was warm.  Well, this morning, it sparked and caught fire.  Needless to say, I'm less than happy.  I've had plenty of other hair dryers that have lasted for many years and even when they ended up breaking, they just stopped working as opposed to almost causing a fire in my house!!!  This is a huge problem.  I have changed my rating.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DRYER!|neg
Best dryer I have ever owned.  I love it.  It took a bit to get it but it was well worth the wait.|pos
My sister had one and I did too.  The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box. Both units did this. Do not buy. No, you're not going to be one of the lucky ones...don't buy this piece of junk.|neg
This little hairdryer is very light, easy to use, with 2 attachments. The controls are easy to use, and there's a button for cooler air so that you can actually set your hair using hot then cold air. I'm very happy with the purchase.|pos
I have previously owed one of these and I really like the convenience of the wall mount. heat and air are great|pos
I had this blow dryer a few years ago it lasted 6 yrs. I have since gone through the chi which broke in 6 months & solano which has completely destroyed my hair....only because I couldn't remember the name of my old dryer. It was just recently while asking a friend if she knew of a good blower that i was reconnected with the twin turbo. It is by far the best blow dryer I have ever had!!|pos
This is a good basic dryer.  I don't use the attachments but find that it works quickly and is easy to hold.  I don't think that it being tourmaline ceramic adds much to the product's quality, but it's still a fine product.|pos
My husband continues to tease me because I continue to gush about how much I love this blow dryer. He says ooooh - it plugs in and blows air - how special (says the man with little hair to blow :) This is a great dryer - I have longish straight hair - and it dries it in a heartbeat without frying my hair - the variety of settings really work well - and the cool shot button is instantaneous. My hair hasn't looked this good in years!|pos
I dont understand the great reviews of others.  This hairdryer is less than average to me.<br /><br />Cons :<br />It does not get very hot.<br />does not have a strong blast.<br />Slow to dry my hair<br />Sucks my hair into the vent on the side and my hair gets stuck in the motor.<br /><br />Pros :<br />feels heavy and substantial.<br /><br />But the REALLY annoying thing is that it sucks my long hair into the vent on the side of the dryer and my hair gets stuck in the motor!!!!!!!!<br />I have to cut my hair out with scissors.  Yeah, OUCH.<br />Who puts the vent on the side, anyway????<br /><br />Dealbreaker.  This machine is going back to the store.|neg
I had this hair dryer for six (6) years. I'm surprised it lasted that long ...given my previous experiences with other dryers that didn't even reach a year of use. Absolutely worth the price.|pos
This is a great hair dryer.  Easy to use and store.  I don't like cords loose on things and the cord stores in the handle of the dryer with just a press of a button.  We had stayed at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington DC and this was the dryer they have in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much that I looked on Amazon.com and sure enough I found it and bought it (much cheaper than I thought it would be too).  My hair is short and fine but this drys it in half of the time as my old one and gives it lots of volume.|pos
This hairdryer works and is easily portable.<br />It been taken to many places since I bought it<br />and my wife - who is fussy about stuff like this -<br />adores it!|pos
When I decided to purchase this..my mind was made up..I was going professional.  The price for a professional hair dryer could be very expensive considering I am not a hairstylist; so I brought this..it was priced in the middle.  I totally love this Elchim!!! I have curly hair and I could straighten it or wear it curly with no frizz.  I would recommend this product.  It's worth every penny.|pos
This hair dryer is great. I especially love the cord keeper feature. Very good product. I would recommend this product to anyone.|pos
It's extremely hot, so it just takes 15-20 minutes for me blow dry my wet hair as if I have ironed it :)|pos
This is an awesome product. I have a mid length hair and it dries them in 5 mins on high-warm setting. There are 2 settings: one for the temperature and the other for speed. So you can choose between cool-warm-hot on one side and low-high on the other end.  The product was delivered on the said delivery date and it is a great value for money.|pos
I had been looking for an affordable but fast drying dryer. This one is amazing. It gets my hair dry a lot quicker, does not overheat, and has great adjustable speeds and heating. However, I will say that the only con to this product is that it is not completely comfortable to hold. I will occasionally hit the cold button on the hair dyer because I don't know where else to comfortably hold it.|pos
I recently stayed in a high-end hotel, and this is the hairdryer that was in my room.  After using it just once, I had to buy one for myself whatever the cost.  When I got home and placed the order, I was surprised and pleased to see that this hair dryer is also a great value.  There are not too many bells and whistles on this dryer, just a good, strong flow of air that isn't too loud.  It also folds into a compact size and includes a retractable cord, so it is easy to store in a drawer.|pos
I am always traveling and needed something light weight and small. After reading other reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I love it. It's very light and small. It also comes with a travel size bag. It doesn't tangle your hair. Very good dryer for those who's always on the go or even if you're not and you want something light and small!!!|pos
This thing takes a damp haired, angry wife, into a glowing beauty with gorgeous hair. It also has a suctioning action that's not advertised, it sucks the angry out of nearby females and it pacifies them in a way I've never seen before.|pos
I ordered thursday night I received Friday night. comparing its price, I really suprised from its quality. It is pleasant to touch its surface and it works very well. I am really oversatisfied. touch wood!! I hope I wont have a trouble in coming days.|pos
My CHI hair dryer had just broken after having it for less than a year and I went to buy a new one at walmart. This one claims to work as well as CHI but it works better. Im obessed with it, it drys my hair faster and makes it so much smoother. It makes my hair shinier and looks smooth even after I straighten it. I highly reccomend buying it.|pos
My wife bought this for our recent Europe trip.  Small, though not tiny like her old one, but plenty of power, folds for packing, dual voltage means no convertor needed for use on 240V/50Hz in Europe (you do need the little plug adaptor, which is not included).  She says sh'll use in place of her old one when we get home.|pos
Fast shipping. Nice weight, high quality product. Great choices of speeds, heat and cooling levels. Dries hair quickly and effortlessly. Highly recommended.|pos
I have really rebel wavy hair and my mom got this as a gift 10 yrs ago. We both used it. She gave it to me abt 4/5 yrs and honestly it sooo good. It leaves ur hair sleek and shiny (depending how good you take care of your hair). Anyway just recently it makes this weird sound and it smells kindda bad haha but i cant complain. I just need a new one after 10 yrs.|pos
This hair dryer is great because of a few key features: 1- the retractable cord. ok ok not so special. 2- it has 3 heat settings, 3 levels of blowing and a cooling button for this price thats unheard of. Its so sturdy and nice and a cool metallic color too. Not loving the neon barbie pink but hey its a great dryer for cheap. And its got some nice attachments too like a huge SERIOUS diffuser !|pos
Perfect for long thin hair that doesn't need to be dry in a salon. It won't burn your hair and will leave it with no friz|pos
I originally bought this for my guest bathroom but decided to put in the master and I am so glad I did. I don't have to get the dryer out everyday to dry my hair. It's right there and the night light feature is great also. My hair isn't thick so the blow power isn't an issue with me but it really blows and drys my hair in no time. I'm thinking about getting another one for our guest bath and for a Christmas gift.|pos
I purchased this hair dryer because when I was staying at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas, they stocked one in the room and I really liked it - so when I got home I ordered one for myself.  In less than a year, the thing kept cutting out on me.  I would wait several minutes to see if it would work again, but it didn't until I kept blowing on it.  Well today it started making some strange loud crackling sounds.  I was going to blow on it, but decided I didn't want to risk it blowing up in my hand.|neg
I bought this hair dryer because I liked that it came with the attachments and that it was reasonably priced. What I found was in addition to the attachments, this hair dryer is very powerful! I recently had to use my old dryer and kept looking at it to make sure I had it on high, then was looking to see if there was dust blocking the way! What a huge difference.<br />I highly recommend this dryer. My only complaint would be the buttons on the handle are not in a great place. I had to get used to holding the dryer and not turning it off by accident. I still give it five stars though!|pos
I purchased this hair dryer over two years ago (after using one at a hotel) and it's still going strong.  It's a great dryer - light weight, perfect size, enough power to dry my hair, and very reasonably priced.  I'm ordering another one as a back up, in case they quit making this model.  Love it!!!|pos
Over heated and shut off within the first five minutes of use. Returned to Amazon. Would in no way recommend|neg
This dryer cuts my drying and styling time in half, it works very well and I am very happy to have bought it.|pos
I own three Andis Turbo 1600w hair dryers. Why?  It has tremendous power and dries hair quickly. The low setting is very adequate.  The Andis is slightly more quiet than most hair dryers.  It's excellent for hair health because the heat temp. is modified.  (severe heat damages hair).  My first Andis is 10 years old. My thanks to the engineers!  This is a very good product.  I have owned countless hair dryers.  At last, I've found the best.|pos
I couldn't get the hose to stay attached (locked) to the bonnet. Used it for 30 mins and it fell off at least 5 times. That was enough for me to return it.|neg
I bought this dryer last year and loved it. I bought the new generation this year and it simply shuts off and overheats way too soon.|neg
This dryer lasted a total of 3, light-duty, months before it died.  I contacted the company who said they'd bend the rules and allow me to send them $55.00 for a replacement.  They said that the vendor who sold the dryer through Amazon was not an authorized seller and they had no way of knowing the condition of the product when I received it.  So, long story short, not a good experience with T3.  It was underpowered when it was working. I don't trust a company who values customer satisfaction so little.|neg
I bought this same dryer 8 years ago and absolutely loved it.  When friends would use it, they'd always wanted to know where I got it but it had been so long that I forgot.  When it blew out (because I dropped the power cord hard on the floor for many'o years) I knew I had to replace it.  I searched for it on Amazon and sure enough, they had it and you can't beat the price.  It's quiet and does a great job on long hair.|pos
This hair dryer is amazing!  My hair is very wavy & @ time very curly,<br />This dryer let's me style my hair easily.  It makes my dryer time so much faster.<br /><br />Love it!!<br /><br />Maggie, River Vale, NJ|pos
This is the second time I purchased the same exact item. My first one lasted at least 4 years! It works.|pos
I have only dried my hair twice with it, because I bought it 2 nights ago. I do like it, it feels quality to me. My hair is a lot less frizzy even After letting it dry half way then finishing with the dryer. I actually have very curly hair that is banana curls underneath and waves everywhere else. I did half my hair with the diffuser for the curls andhalf my head straight(no I didn't go out in public like this) and I like it for styling both ways. It's heavier then my red Revlon dryer and blue contair but it does a better job. I hated my blue dryer b/c I always had frizzy hair afterwards. The red dryer was like a someone blowing on my hair themselves no power at all. So far so good, I purchased mine at target, they have the dryers they sell on display so you can pick them up and feel the weight and shape I would suggest finding a local target that offers that before buying a new dryer. Make sure it's right weight for yourself, I was ok with it and I have corporal tunnel ion both my arms.|pos
would give it a 0 if i could<br />bonnet had a hole in it, and the air just doesnt seem to get through. this is a cheap product--make the investment!|neg
I've had my share of hair dryers in my life time, so I confess I was relieved when my old one died. I knew exactly what I wanted: 1. Ionic technology because it helps reduce my frizzies.<br />2. At least 3 heat settings. Tired of warm and TOO HOT.<br />3. Power. My hair is thick and it takes some air velocity to dry it. Most dryers are pretty good, but the Turbo Setting does increase it. It's not wind tunnel awesome, but it's helpful.<br />This hair dryer met those requirements. As noted by several other reviewers, it is a bit larger and heavier than most other hand held hair dryers. If that is not an issue for you, I think you will like it.|pos
I just returned from a trip to Israel and this travel dryer performed beautifully.  All I needed was the plug adapter that I had purchased and when I set the dryer to the international voltage the dryer functioned perfectly.  I had no issue with over heating and had really effective power which was far superior to the dryer in our bathroom provided by the hotel.  I also appreciated the folding feature making it easy to pack.  Highly recommend!!!!|pos
This is the second Andis hair dryer that I have purchased because I like it so much. When we remodeled our bathroom, this is the hairdryer that came to mind. I like the night light feature. It is very bright and GREEN! The dryer has plenty of power and has an adjustable heat setting. Can't go wrong with this product. Our first one is at least 20 years old and we are now using it in a different bathroom.|pos
Conair 1875 hair dryer<br /><br />stopped working in less than a month.  The reset button won't click, so it won't start.  Don't feel like the hassle of trying for a credit or return, don't have packaging.  Am going to buy local where I can easily return something.|neg
Mine stopped working in less than 3 months.  As I was drying my hair it all of the sudden stopped.  Nothing I could do would make it turn back on.  It wasn't that expensive but I do expect it to last longer than 3 months.|neg
I noticed an immediate difference in the texture of my hair after purchasing this hair dryer.  It took less time to dry, and it was much smoother, which was great because I have very thick hair.  The size and weight are fine.  I agree with other reviewers that the blue light is weird, but it's really not a big deal--you could cover it with electrical tape if it really drove you nuts.  I've had the hair dryer for a few months and have no complaints--it's been a great addition to my hair care arsenal.|pos
I purchased two of the hairdryers on Aug 12th, and today is Sept. 13th so they are only one month old.  I have been careful to sort of break in the first one by using low power for a minute before going to high power and then to switch to low power when I am finished before turning off.  I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time.  So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves.  It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like.  The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else.  Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product.  Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc.  However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.  Hopefully that will stay the same for months ahead.|pos
Great product, easy and fast results. love it!! Fast shipping.. I have curly hair and this product straightens my hair in about twenty-twenty five minutes.. and I am no professional.|pos
After purchasing several other dryers, this is the one! My old Conair Baby, that was ancient, bit the dust. The newer versions were a pale comparison, so I started searching. My requirements were: relatively light weight, doesn't sound like a jet engine, larger than usual air blowing surface, long enough cord, a little less than 1800 watts. This is, by far, the nearest thing to my old Conair Baby that I found. I actually went back and ordered another for a spare. I've been using this now for a few months I think, & I love it.|pos
Our old dryer died and we decided to try this one for the ionic system. The dryer is very fast, has mutiple settings and my wife who didn't like hair dryers, because she has very fine hair, really likes this one and uses it. It does a very good job and this model seems perfect to me.|pos
This dryer is very cheaply made.  I used it once; did not work second time. I went to Rite Aid and bought a small Conair travel dryer (which I've had before). Great dryer!|neg
I was able to test drive this hair dryer at La bellaserra hotel in Paso Robles.  It was so fantastic I had to get one for home.  Leaves your hair soft and dries it  in less time!|pos
I've been searching for a great quality hair dryer and decided to give this one a try after reading all the great reviews. This product is every bit as AWESOME as people have said!!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! I have shoulder length, curly hair and this dryer cuts my drying time in half. Worth every single penny!!!!|pos
My wife loves this new hair dryer.  It blows her old hair dryer away.  She has been very please.  We have not issues with the product at this time.  She uses it most days.|pos
Buttons on the dryer are not user friendly, if you are planning to use often its not a good buy.|neg
I bought this for my wife and she really likes it, she says it's the best hair dryer she has ever used in her life.|pos
Only been using this for about a week now so I can't speak to the longevity of the dryer but I really love it so far.  Hair dryers have always been kind of hit and miss, mostly miss for me.  They are usually not strong enough, or too hot, or not hot enough, or cheaply made (even expensive ones), etc.  I have thick long hair and it takes forever to dry.  This dryer is amazing.  It has several settings and on the hottest, strongest setting I can dry my hair faster than any other dryer I've had.  But it doesn't get overly hot either.  I don't feel like I'm burning my hair and scalp as I have with other dryers.  As someone who has been on the hunt for the perfect dryer for decades, I feel like I finally found one.  I'm tempted to buy a bunch so I have them for the future in case this one ever goes away.|pos
Heats instantly, dries hair very quickly and it's much quieter than any other brand I've ever had...well worth the price.|pos
So...my girlfriend has this really super thick, straight, shiny, enviable mane of dark red, beautiful butt-length hair.  She mantains it so thoroughly and with so much detail, her daily routine usually takes substantial effort and time.<br /><br />With our old high end hair dryer I started referring to this ritual of hers as Hairnobyl because it raised the temperature of the bathroom 20 degrees, dimmed the lights, made me turn up the TV really loud, the dogs would hide in other rooms and communication was impossible (her mouth would move...but...).  After the 30 minutes of excruciating noise I was climbing the wall...not to mention a repetitive-use shoulder pain she developed.<br /><br />Then I bought her this dryer.<br /><br />Her shoulder feels better because it's so much lighter, and it takes about half the time.  It is also more effective...makes her hair really shiny.<br /><br />We now own two of these...they are great!  She's an expert, and when she raves about a hair product...trust me...it is WIN!|pos
A long time Elchim user here- didn't think anything was better than the hot heat and forceful blow. Well- this is better than that! Fastest drying time ever, heat is right on. It is a little heavy, which frankly- none of the GOOD dryers are light, so you can't really ding it on that. I have hair to below my shoulder blades, wavy/frizzy, colored- and this makes it ALMOST to the point of no flat iron. Worth the price, just the best dryer ever!|pos
I am LOVING this blow dryer! My hair feels so soft and looks much more shiny!!!! I'm hoping it isnt like the other reviews and doesnt break in a few weeks bc I love this brand and will never buy another cheap Walmart brand!!!!!|pos
I needed a smaller hair dryer with a diffuser to use while traveling.  I saw this Conair and decided to give it a try.  It works great and the diffuser is a good one.  It fits well into my suitcase, taking up little room.  I can't use hotel hair dryers because they do not have diffusers so this Conair is a great answer to my hairdo needs.  I have very wavy and thick hair and I like to have it curl.  To do this I need a diffuser and this hair dryer comes with one.  It's a little difficult to attach the diffuser but once attached it's stable and does not come off.  (On other hair dryers I've had the problem of diffusers coming off while I'm in the middle of drying my hair).  I highly recommend this hair dryer as an alternative to the larger ones, or as a second one to use while traveling.|pos
I do not buy anithing without try it first. But this blower its really great. its fast and powerfull, and reduce the time of drying in half. I love this product.|pos
I bought this dryer about a week ago because I've recently become natural and I needed a hooded dryer for hot oil treatments and deep conditioning. This is my first time using the dryer and I hate it. The price was reasonable and now I understand why. It is so noisy I can't take it. The worst part of it is that I found a dryer in my closet which I clearly forgot about and now i'm stuck with an overly noisy dryer that I will never use again. If you plan on buying a dryer please please read the product reviews from people who have purchased it. I failed to do that and if I did I wouldn't be stuck with a noisy dryer.|neg
Bought this to replace my reliable Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hair dryer which lasted over 4 years.  This model is the newer replacement version.  Newer but definitely NOT better. It lasted only 3 months before before it burned out; sparks, smoke and then death. Cheaply made junk!!!|neg
I paid around 68 bucks for this a year ago. It never worked right. The front would get scalding hot and the back would stay cool and it was very loud. I used it maybe three times, four at the most and hated it. The fourth or fifth time I went to use it, it made a pop noise and then nothing. It never worked again. I cannot find anyone to fix it or replace it.  Of course, it crapped out after the warranty expired. DO NOT BUY THIS DRYER! It is a total hunk of junk. It still looks brand new, but its just a giant paper weight now.|neg
I was really surprised when I received this hair dryer because the quality of the product~ IT IS GREAT<br />The dryer is very affordable and has a great look and feel and puts out nice heat.  I would definitely recommend this product to friends and am very happy with it.|pos
Great product for the price. Works great and has nice settings. It came with two snap on extentions which both work nice on my hair.|pos
I've been a stylist for 15 yrs and I can tell you nothing compares to this dryer in terms of closing the cuticle with added shine however I do recommend getting the Twin Turbo/ionic for $30 more it's worth every penny. I couldn't be more happier and it's made in Italy so the finest materials go into construction and you can feel it. The weight and the little kickback when turned on sounds crazy but this this is powerful.|pos
I have very thick hair and go through blow dryers quite frequently. I am always upset when I have to spend so much($75+) on something I know I will have to replace.<br /><br />Well this dryer has been WONDERFUL! I have had it much longer than I have had any other blow dryer. Also I can rest easy knowing that if I do have to replace it it is well within a reasonable price.<br /><br />Thank you Conair!|pos
La nano-cer&aacute;mica i&oacute;nica seca el cabello tecnolog&iacute;a como ninguna otra. En vez de seco, paja-como el pelo seco el Andis proporciona un secado flexible y suave que hace que el pelo se siente muy sano y natural.|pos
While it may not be the most powerful or versatile hair dryer available, it is certainly the most convenient.  I bought this as a replacement for the exact same model that lasted several years.  My wife wanted this one replaced when the plastic internal fan blades broke apart, but that was after 5-10 years of regular use.  My wife has one or two others that have specialty attachments  and are probably more powerful, but this is the one that she uses as the primary one, because it is always right there, nothing to pull out and plug in etc. It's just there and it is powerful enough to handle most every requirement. I use it infrequently but my short hair is dry in less than a minute.|pos
I bought 3 Sunbeam 1500 wall mount hairdryer back in 2000 and had used them since. After a few years' use I noticed the plastic part got a small hole burnt. I found a way to still use it by letting it sit until it cooled down before placing it back into the mounting fixture. So based on the durability of the product I bought this model again expecting Bunbeam to have improved in the design about the heat discipation. My previous 3 dryer are still working but I changed them all anyway.<br />I'm impressed with the new design - it becomes more stylish and after drying my hair when I hold the blow hole by hand it's just mildly warm - not hot at all. It is not a very quiet hairdryer but I'm happy with the purchase. I expect to last 20 years.|pos
I have tried many types of hair dryers from inexpensive to professional.  I have long medium thick hair.  This one saves me so much time and my hair turns out looking healthy and shiny.  I rarely use my straightener any more.|pos
When you turn it on setting 2. Its smells real bad..<br />There are no holes for the heat to come out in the sides. Setting. 1 dose not get very hot..<br />I would not recommend this product to know one..|neg
I have used this product at three other facilities and it is a value for the cost. Mounts easily and works as detailed.|pos
I have wanted a T3 Hair Dryer for several years after watching presentations on infomercials.  My hands don't function well and holding a blow dryer up to dry my short but difficult to dry hair has been a challenge for years.  I finally decided to shop around and get myself one.  I am very happy with the diffusers and how quickly my hair dries using the dryer, however I would like it if it folded for travel.  That doesn't detract from my enjoyment and less pain in my hands having this new product to use.|pos
I love this hair dryer!  It works so well with my thick hair.  I recommend this hair dryer to anyone with thick hair.|pos
excellent dryer! very powerful, love it so much.  Arrived earlier than expected, and works like a salon dryer.  Im so relieved because I had gotten previous dryers that were so weak and kept my hair wet.  This one dries my thick hair in less than 10 minutes|pos
Beware that after some use of this dryer, the cord loosens at its connection to the body of the dryer.  If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately.  I didn't.  I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again.  The next event was flames shooting out at me through the spot where the cord exits the body of the hair dryer.  It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.<br /><br />When this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection.|neg
This is really a great hair dryer. I love the cool setting after drying my hair with the heat.  WOuld not trade it for anything.|pos
I have been a stylist for over 10 years now and was also a auto mechanic too, so I do have knowledge on how things work. People blaming the dryer on damaging their wife's hair are idiots. If the hair was breaking off its due to her stylist over processing her hair! I dryer isn't going to break hair.........it melts/burns it and only if the user doesn't properly know how to use it. Probably why the husband is writing the review cause he is the woman in the relationship since the woman probably has no clue how to cook since you can't keep one area under constant heat for too long of a period.<br /><br />No for a real review!<br /><br />I owned the origanl version of the dryer by paramount velectra the. Which was a full size dryer with a long cord and worked great for the 7 yrs I owned it till it was stolen......I guarantee it is still working.<br /><br />So 3 years ago a old girlfriend bought the sedu version since many of the top educators in the hair industry use it (even the new Sam villa dryer is very similar).  It may be heavy for some people, but it is well balanced. Has a long cord like the old the, controls are never in the way....so it not changing the settings in the middle of a blow dry like you would with all the chi's. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to blow drying.........haven't even owned a flat iron in the last 5 years since most my clients like volume and movement. The sedu gets the job done faster than any dryer on the market......makes the t3 look like a Helen of troy dryer. I got lucky and was able to pick up the tgr 4000i (same dryer) from a beauty supply store for $37........these dryers were once priced at $280 6-7 years ago. Btw.......I finally picked up a flat iron this week........GHD is the only way to go........I used to own a chi and a digital chi wet to dry and there is no comparison.|pos
I'm a woman of color with healthy hydrated curly textured hair. It is ESSENTIAL that I have a high quality blow dryer to get a nice smooth blowout without frizz and no damage. I didnt expect anything from this $13 dryer, but figured what could it hurt to have something less bulky to travel with to the beach that works internationally. I used it at home a few times and I am IMPRESSED. I've spent HUNDREDS of dollars on T3, CHI Pro, Superstar -- and they all work GREAT. Well, while this isnt  100% comparable, its near 80% comparable. Fantastic quality! This is one of your best bets for a good quality, high heat/non damaging air flow cheap travel blow dryer that doesnt cost a fortune. I will say that my hair frizzed up much easier when I hit the DC humidity than it does when I use my other blow dryers. But still, a small, minor complaint given that it is less than $20, travels well without taking up space, and gets a decent temperature with good air flow.|pos
I purchased the Yellowbird in September.  I only used it two or three times a week, and by January it was broken.  The heating element died and now it only blows cold air. I should have kept the cheap hair dryer I've had since high school.  What a waste of money!|neg
I used one of these at the Marriot, and I loved it so much that I had to have one!  Love the power that it has and the folding handle.|pos
This is a basic somewhat compact blow dryer that worked well in the beginning. As described it has two blower speeds and two heat settings and that's it. The cord is a decent length without being too long or too short. If anything the high speed blower setting might be too fast, but it's not a big problem. However, I have had three of these , so read the updates.  Update#1: After  3 months the first one is still blowing and going. Came back and ordered another. Nothing but good things to say about this little hair dryer.  Update# 2: June 17, 2013: The first of two dryers I bought like this one stopped working today. It lasted about 10 months before the off/on switch smoked and went limp. It flops back and forth completely useless. Not as much of a bargain as I thought at first. But, I am ordering another and writing this bad switch off as bad luck. My 3rd one is on the way.  Update #3: In less than 4 months the second hair dryer quit. That is 2 of the three we own. I am not buying a fourth one.  Update #4: The third dryer has quit. Not one of the three lasted more than 10 months. It is not worth the hassle to return these cheap hair dryers. The cost of shipping both ways is more than buying a new one. Three hairdryers in just over a year all bought here on Amazon. The one I used the longest lasted 10 months. Andis is not a quality hair dryer in fact to me it is the definition of &#34;too cheap to be true&#34; junk.|neg
The biggest complaint I have about this dryer is that the buttons which are very sensitive are located exactly where your fingers go in order to hold it so I am constantly hitting them by mistake. To try to avoid that makes you hold the dryer in a very awkward manner. You would think they would notice when testing.  It is also heavy and bulky. I did not notice any additional shine to my hair.  The low setting is really cool and the hot is not very hot.  Takes a lot longer to dry my very short hair.  The only thing I did like was the hanging hoop. If I hadn't purchased it a long time ago as a back-up dryer I would return it.|neg
Other reviews indicate the advertising was in error as the unit did NOT include acool slection.  The one we received DID have this. The unit is extremely light and gets the job done.|pos
I also found this dryer at a hotel. Loved how quickly it dried my very thick hair! Was even happier when I found out how inexpensive it is!|pos
This item was a great price and I was very happy with it for the first few uses.  It dries my hair in half the time that I was spending with a drugstore brand.  Unfortunately, the tip of the nozzle is melting.  It may be because it's made out of lightweight plastic.  Real bummer as I was so thrilled with its performance.|neg
Best hair dryer I've ever had. My first one lasted 12 to 15 years of daily use, lost count of how old it was. My guess that it died at age 110 in hair dyer years.|pos
I bought this dryer after trying it at a hotel we stayed at.  Love the way it folds up and is easy to transport and store. Great product at a great price|pos
I love this hair dryer! My first one finally died and I ordered the very same one because it performed so well and lasted so long. I highly recommend it.|pos
Love this hair dryer. The different speeds are great and drys fast Got it fast in the mail love that.|pos
I just LOVE my new Conair hair dryer! Very sturdy feeling and the buttons/controls work smoothly- much better hair dryer than my Revlon 1875 which was awkward and cheaply constructed. I have always preferred the Conair Ion Shine and am glad to have a new Conair at a pricetag of $13 ???<br />Motor does seem quieter than my other hair dryers and the 'cool shot' button is an added bonus.<br />Might just have to get another at this price. :)|pos
a little powerhouse, that stores its own cord, fits nicely in a drawer, and, so far, reliable.  I used this model at the Four Seasons Santa Barbara, and was able to locate it on Amazon.  I ordered one for each of my bathrooms!|pos
I've had this for a while now and it is still working perfectly. Dries my hair quickly and doesn't leave it as frizzy when I use it with the included extension. The different heat settings are great too; I like having a cool option instead of just a cool button.|pos
I am a hair stylist and I am about to open my own salon.  There is a lot of stress involved in opening your own business but receiving the CORRECT product should not be one of them.  I did my research and ordered through Amazon because noone had ever let me down when ordering through them.  Until now.  I ordered a portable hair dryer and waited patiently for it to be delivered.  When I received it, I opened the box and began putting it together.  One of the pieces did not fit so I just thought that maybe I was doing it wrong.  After myself, my landlord, AND a maintenance man tried to put it together, we all agreed that the wrong part was delivered and that I should call customer service to ask for a replacement.  After one email and two phone messages, I received a phone call back only to tell me that the manager said that the piece does fit and to try harder.  WHAT??!!  I tried so hard that I gashed my finger!  The customer service agent was very nice but had to relay this message to me from the manager.  So my question is...How in the world do you know if THIS piece actually fits?!  Is it possible that I received a faulty part?????  So now my only two choices are to go back and try to fit this piece in and possible hurt myself worse (it's a metal pole by the way) or send it back.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS COMPANY.  So now I am back to the start and my salon opens in less than three weeks.  Thank you, Mix Wholesale, for wasting my time.|neg
Everyone should own this hair dryer.  Throws out a lot of heat, works very well with Afro-American hair. The comb is very strudy. Only complaint it is somewhat heavier than what I expected.|pos
This hairdryer has all the features I want: retractable cord, powerful, folds up, cool botton and attractive.  I bought mine over 5 years ago and used it every other day, and the cord and casing all are in excellent condition still, but the motor just died.  I think over 5 years is a reasonable time, so I'm bying the same one again.|pos
I've had my blo and go for a month now, after a recent accident left me severely handicapped this little item has saved my life when it comes to getting my hair dried. Can't recommend this enough whether you got one or both hands you just won't believe how much help this is.|pos
This dryer is constructed to be a first class item.  Works very well for many uses, we used it to remove vinyl letters from  our trailer.  Did a great job.|pos
Have owned this hairdryer for less than six months, and it has already ceased to work.  Very, very disappointed because I like the style and the size of the unit.  It just stopped working; wasted my money!|neg
I can't believe you would send me an appliance that uses 110V. I cannot use this hairdryer as I cannot plug it in. Australia has 240V. Do you have an adaptor that converts 240V to110V?|neg
I thought this hair dryer would be great for traveling because it folds and has the retractable cord.  First hotel I plugged it in, the power in our room went out.  Second hotel, same thing.  I didn't use it the rest of our trip.  I tried it again when we got home.  As soon as I tried to plug it in it sparked.  In the trash it went.  Big waste of money,|neg
This dryer works great and saves space.  I have one at our home and at our Lake House.  I love the night lite it has.  Its easy to hang on the wall and looks nice too.|pos
I did considerable research before choosing the Andis RC-2 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer for my wife.  She wanted a dryer that was easy to store and that would dry her hair quickly.  So far it meets all of her expectations and we're very satisfied.  We are being careful with the retractable cord as others have suggested.|pos
This blow dryer was purchased to replace a similar one.......just love the fact that the cord retracts!  It's not cumbersome, has two speeds and a cooling option.  Terrific value for the money.|pos
As a cosmetologist, we all need a professional blower, shipped a lot sooner than what I expected and worked perfectly fine. Brand new product.|pos
I would order with them again for sure. Package arrived in a timely fashion. Love the product. Professional correspondence with them.|pos
I purchased this a while back and still works great. I definitely would recommend to buy this product, worth the money and the item shipped fast! :)|pos
I just love it. I was looking for a professional hair dryer for styling and it's exactly what I was looking for. The heat is just perfect and it keeps the hair shiny.|pos
This is a neat little hair dryer that has alot of power and does not take up much space. I really like it.|pos
This product works really good and the price is reasonable. I strongly recommanded.<br />I will say this might be the best choice for product in this price range.|pos
This is an amazingly sturdy and powerful hair dryer.  Really dries my hair quickly and allows for easy styling.  This one should last me a long time.|pos
Love this. it's light weight which is nice and easy to use. I have a lot of hair, and it dries so fast with this hair dryer! would def recommend it!|pos
I have very thick hair that is difficult to dry. This hair dryer is powerful and dries my hair quickly and easily. I love it.|pos
This dryer costs and weighs twice as much as my good old Conair dryer that lasted me 15 years, but works no better. I wish I bought something else. It is bulky, heavy and slow. Not sure why does the maker claim that the hair becomes shiny and silky because of their dryer. Mine did not get better a single bit.<br /><br />Update 5 months later: it slowed down substantially after 5 months in service.|neg
This replaced a hairdryer that's oh, about 25 years old and still working. Gotta say, it's a welcome change. Love the ionic aspect, and it leaves my hair very manageable. Powerful but quiet motor. Other reviewers have commented that it has a funny smell. I can't say I've noticed, and there's never any reason to blow it in my face, so not a problem. Love the soft feel of the housing, love the little rubber bumper that doesn't allow it to slide on the countertop, love the long cord ... maybe I'll get 25 years out of this one, too!|pos
This little hair dryer really does the trick! I will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option, but for me, with my long, thin and falling out hair its perfect. It doesn't get SUPER hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus. I have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but I was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying doesn't release and so far I am very happy with the product. It comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well. I love it!|pos
The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.<br /><br />The product info here is incorrect. There is NO cool shot button on this thing.|neg
Initially purchased this for traveling since it has the ability to work with European voltage as well as US. I now use it every day. Its light and powerful. Highly recommend.|pos
My hair dryer broke a while ago and I finally decided to replace it with this one. I found it at walmart for $35, which wasn't the most expensive one that they had, but I've used John Frieda products before so I figured it would be a good try. So far, I really like this dryer. It feels like it could be a lot more expensive.<br />I compared it to my mother's $80 or so hairdryer and it actually keeps up with it pretty well. I really like how the engine feels and sounds. It works pretty quiet and has a low hum rather than the high pitched noise a lot of cheap-o hairdryers have. It doesn't shoot the air quite as fast and it doesn't get QUITE as hot as the $80 blowdryer my mom has, but it's pretty great at it's job because my hair actually looks better when I use this hairdryer vs the more expensive one. It definitely fights frizz very well.<br />The only problem I'd say I have with it is that it's a heavier dryer than my old one that broke. I say problem because people may dislike that but I prefer it that way. When dryers have a bit of weight to them I feel like they've got a stronger motor. Not to mention I really don't notice when I'm using it.<br />As for the people complaining about the buttons, I can't say that I can relate. I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer. I'm very happy I purchased it.|pos
This works awesome! Great or long thick hair. I love the speed and the cooling feature actually works, others that Ive had do not really feel cooler..this works great for a finished look.|pos
Was looking for a blow dryer that would dry my thick hair in under 45 minutes and I found it. Definitely not for thin hair.<br /><br />This is exactly what I was looking for.|pos
This is a LAME hair drier. Take a long time to dry my hair - has no power. The settings dont function correctly either.<br />Don't cheap out - you get what you pay for in this case.|neg
I like this dryer. It works well and I like the night light as well. It works well for a small bathroom.|pos
I have thicker, curly hair, so my stylist recommended I get a blow dryer with a diffuser attachment. I got this dryer 3 weeks ago, and have been using the diffuser attachment, and kept noticing little black things on the bathroom floor. Then I realized they were the rubber fingertips from the attachment. More than half of them are broken off. I don't use the attachment aggressively, and have not dropped it on the floor. I'm really disappointed it was such poor quality it didn't even last a month. Now I'll have to buy a new blow dryer, because without the diffuser attachment, it's useless to me. And buying a new attachment with shipping is as much as a new dryer. Bad job, Conair!!!|neg
At present, I am using this hair dryer at home.  I like it so much that I am going to buy another one for my travel bag. When I visit family and friends I like to bring my own hair dryer so I keep one packed in my suitcase.<br />This hair dryer is light and powerful.  My hair looks better than it did when I used my previous dryer-shinier and easy to manage.|pos
I have only used this dryer once, but it works very well.  My hair is fine so it doesn't take long to dry so this dryer does the job quickly.  All in all, I'm pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to others.|pos
I love this hair dryer. It is so light weigh and powerful that I am stiling my hair a lot faster than before.|pos
I purchased this dryer and it has been a complete disaster...luckily I am here to tell the story. It is DANGEROUS...the dryer must have overheated...started melting and caught on firm. It caused burns on my scalp and neck...I would love to sue the company for a defective and health hazard product.[[ASIN:B0012HEGCI HOT Tools Tourmaline Ionic 1875 Watt Rollaround Dryer with Pro-moisture System Model #1059 Sale!]]|neg
I purchased the black one via Amazon and I am very pleased with the product so far. I've always wanted a simple solution to great hair and this is exactly it. I used to own a Conair from the drug store and this Sedu has changed my perspective on hair dryers. I've always thought that I can never re-produce the kind of blow out that I get from salons but this hair dryer has made it possible. The air is pretty strong and I don't find the hair dryer heat up more than my drug store one. It does take most of the frizz away and my hair stays in a nice curve for the whole day when I use a round brush.<br /><br />To be fair though, this hair dryer more expensive so you would expect the higher quality to match the price tag. Another thing I found is that it's actually kinda heavy for its size. My old one is bigger but actually weight about the same as this one, maybe even less. If you are looking for a feather weight, maybe this is not for you. Other than that, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Loving it so far!|pos
I spotted this in the Target luggage section for about the same price and loved it at first sight and had to have it!!!!  It's the tiniest dryer I've ever seen!!!  It almost fits in the palm of my hand.  Folded, it's 4-5 inches long (not counting the cord).  I've been using it for about a week now just to test it out before my trip abroad and it's surprisingly very strong.  No weird smells as someone else mentioned- maybe their particular product has an issue.  So far mine is working great.  My hair is shorter so I'm not worried about how long it will take, but this thing is pretty strong.  I'm done in minutes.  The other great thing is that it has &#34;dual voltage.&#34;  I had to read up on this because I haven't traveled in a while and I guess a whole lot of electronics and stuff like this is made dual voltage today- so check your product and educate yourself.  Just look at this hair dryer, for example, and it will say 125V / 250V on the handle.  This means it will work anywhere where the voltage falls in that range... most if not all of the world. BUT YOU WILL NEED AN ADAPTER when going abroad with this.  So here is the tricky part if this stuff is new for you, too... you DON'T need a converter (more expensive) for anything that's dual voltage,  just an adapter.  The adapter is just the little plug part that goes into the wall so you can plug it in.  The converter is usually bigger and box-like and more expensive.  It converts the voltage. You can find adapters for just a few bucks.  Some dual voltage products have a little switch you have to bother with and it's dangerous if you forget to change that switch... no switch and no worries with this hair dryer!!  Just Google dual voltage and you can read up on it, and the difference between converter and adapter.  All these things are helpful to know when traveling abroad.  I love this thing... best thing I bought for travel recently since finding a hand-held luggage scale!  I originally jumped the gun and gave this5 stars.  Read my updates below.  12/20/12 Update:  This survived a trip to rural abroad and worked great, so long as I used it on low.  When I turned it on high it was like a crazy loud rocket ship and I thought it would take off or start fire- it was frightening!!!!  Yes, I did use my adapter, and it's possible it behaved this way because of the junkie old remote house with questionable wiring I was living in. Later I lived in a second, very modern house in the country's modern capital and it wouldn't plug into the wall at all in any part of the house!!  Yes, it was the right plug shape and I have no idea what that was about, again, the randomness is possibly the result of the house and the country I was in.  Who knows.  But I couldn't use it at all the last couple of months of my travels and that wasn't good.  I will continue to use it here at home in the USA where it works perfect.  Maybe better for local travel and still a great size if you have limited luggage space.  But I am changing my rating from 5 to 3 because the darn thing nearly gave me a heart attack the few times I accidentally put it on high while trying to turn it off.  I am still highly recommending this product for travel, but taking it abroad may be questionable.  1/15/13 UPDATE:  I barely started using it back home a month and the dang thing started making crazy noises and I thought it would explode or catch fire.  It basically went dead.  I tossed it in the garbage.  I am now changing my 3 star rating to 1 star.  I was wrong.  Turns out this was a piece of unreliable junk and potentially dangerous unreliable junk after all... didn't even last me a year.  And I barely used it!!!  Not fit for my traveling adventures.|neg
I didin't purchase this from amazon however this is the weakest, worst dryer I have ever used.  I have owed several in my life as I have very long hair.  This takes about 25 minutes to dry my hair fully whereas other dryers I have owned previously it took maybe 10 minutes.  One of the reason I wanted to try it was for the retractable cord which unfortunately does not work!!!  I pulled it out the first time I used it and it would only retract about 50% of the way with the rest of the cord hanging like other dryers without retractable cords.  I would have to advise to avoid this dryer like the plague.  It isn't even that cheap for what you get so I can't see why someone would own this.  I'm def going back to babyliss.  Sorry conair.|neg
I bought this hair dryer because it is the one my hair stylist uses in her salon. And, since it's such a strong dryer, it takes much less time to dry my hair. Also, it does a better job than any other hair dryer I have ever owned.|pos
I was really affraid to purchase this product on line, since its just coming out as one of Pibbs newest editions. I must admit,this blow dyer is hands down top of the line,I work mainly with blowouts on natural hair clients,Im saying this blow dryer can straighten out the thickest kinky tightly coiled hair hands down, during the blow drying process the hair is left super shinny and super manageable, oh and not to mention the drying time, I'm throwing the in towel on that one,just made my job easier, super light weight, not heavy like the other dryers use to be, my dryer for ever,love,love,love my new pibbs,faster drying time+more clients= fast money;)|pos
I used this hair dryer for the first time at a hotel and just had to have one.  I love it!!  It's lightweight, has a retractable cord and folds.  Great for travel or storage!  I'm on my 2nd one and bought a 3rd to keep just in case.|pos
The ceramic dryer made drying my hair much easier than ever before. It cut my time down drastically and no more tangles at all. I love this hair dryer!|pos
What a fantastic hair dryer.  It has the cooler setting, but with the same wind power as the high setting so you can get your hair dry and smooth without burning it.  I have owned numerous dryers from Vidal Sassoon and Conair and many other brands, however this is just the best and so well priced.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Andis.|pos
this t3 is easy to use and much lighter than other dryers. it dries faster and leaves the hair shiny.|pos
I love this hair dryer.  I have fine, thin, hightlighted hair and it is the best blow dryer I have ever used.  Highly recommend.|pos
Lightweight, quieter than most, and dries my hair in half the time! All dryers are NOT the same and this one is great for smoothing and straightening!|pos
I first discovered this hairdryer at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua resort and loved it.  I ordered one for myself as soon as I returned home.  Love the way it dries my hair without scorching, frizzing or so much pressure I can't style it properly.  Medium works great for me.  Also loved the folding handle as my bathroom space is limited.  As others have mentioned, be careful not to pull the cord out too far, as mine stopped retracting after 18 months.  With almost 3 years of daily use, it finally died.  I immediately ordered another one.  At this price, one every 3 years is a bargain.|pos
This hair dryer is very quiet, drys quickly, prevents frizz and includes two attachments all for an extremely low price. It's the best hair dryer I have ever used. Added bonus, the cord reeler function makes storage a breeze. A must have!|pos
I wanted a ceramic dryer because my old dryer was dryng out my hair and making it appear dry and course.  I purchased this ceramic, ionic dryer to protect my hair and also achieve<br />a softer look. Itgave the results that I was looking for. It certainly works! Also a good feature it the automatic cord wind. I am very pleased. The dryer was reduced in price and<br />this made the purchase sweeter as it is a great product at a bargain price.<br />I would certainly recommend this dryer and it deserves the 5 star rating.|pos
This is the 2nd one I've bought and the first from Amazon.  I loved the first one and had it for many years.  I paid less with amazon for this one and even though the first one hadn't stopped working it started to smell hot and I didn't want to take a chance.  I will continue to purchase this product as long as it's available.  My hair is long and it takes no time at all to dry and looks great.|pos
I'm happy with the Infiniti by Conair 223XR dryer and its features. Retractable cord, 1875 watts, different settings for cold/warm/hot temperature and also low/high air speed setting. I like the fact that it already comes with both a concentrator and diffuser. It doesn't take long to dry my long hair (up to 70% faster than previous ones) and no frizz effect! I think the cord is long enough and there is a red mark to indicate when to stop pulling. The dryer has a nice design and color. I've been using this dryer for few months and I highly recommend it.|pos
I bought this dryer for 3 reasons,: 1. My dryer is about to pass on 2. I have arthritis in my shoulder & wanted a lighter weight one & 3. Based on the reviews here I purchased this dryer. I wasn't planning on paying a ton for a dryer, my daughter's a professional & I don't see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear & tear!<br />I have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry. Well, my hair was dry in half the time & it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder & irritate my arthritis. It has a nice defusser, nice & small, not long like others so you can actually hold it away from your hair & not burn your hair or scalp. I am very pleased so far & will look for other hair care products by this company. I definetly would recommend it!!|pos
Love this hair dryer!  I used it at a hotel recently and couldn't believe the power of this little dryer.  I have long, thick hair and my hair was dry in no time! Would definately recommend!|pos
Good power.  Easy to handle.  Settings don't get in the way of the handle.  This is the third one I've bought.|pos
I've been using ConAir Infiniti Pro for over 10 years, still works perfectly fine. Recently, I decided to buy one more for my 2nd bathroom, and bought Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler. This new unit died on Day 1, I returned it and bought a new Conair Infiniti Pro again.<br /><br />Reminds me of the saying: Buy expensive, cry once. Buy cheap, cry every day|neg
Had to return after the first time I used the Product, the hose burned off the bonnet connection was impossible to dry my hair with this product. Very loud and only dries one section of your head.|neg
Love these dryers! Had one for 9 years, finally burned out. Just bought 2 more. So convenient to have it right there on the wall, and the night light is a bonus.|pos
This hair dryer does a very good job. It has multiple settings for heat and fan speed. Very good value.|pos
My wife and I always comment on how nice the hair dryers are in a hotel. This is exactly what we were looking for. It pretty much cuts the drying time in half from our old hair dryer.|pos
This dryer was a great one during the 8 months that it worked. Loved the retractable cord and how fast it could dry my overly-thick hair.<br /><br />Usually when I burn up a dryer, I have some notice (burnt motor smell, maybe some popping noises), but not this one. It worked fine yesterday, and today would not work. Checked the outlets, did the test/reset on the dryer and that worked, but the dryer itself is dead. Reviews at other sites show this to be a non-uncommon problem.|neg
I purchased this product after reading all the reviews, and it did not disappoint.  I love it because it dries nicely, it's not too noisy to operate plus it has a retractable cord.  I would say it's well worth the price I bought it from Amazon compared to other blow dryers!!|pos
After two months it just keeps overheating! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off. I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair. Not very powerful, a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill.|neg
What is so exciting about a hair dryer? What a difference it makes in shine, silkiness and styling.  I read reviews on hair dryers priced from $$$ to $. I chose this dryer based upon consistently good reviews, benefits, features and price.  This dryer changed my baby fine, thin hair that frizzes in humidity and loses volume in dry climates to lovely, silky brilliantly shiny locks.  I know, it sounds far fetched, but for me, this dryer delivered what it claimed.  Thank you to all that reviewed this product over the months.  You helped me choose a great hair dryer.  Before those of you in the market for a new hair dryer plunk down $200 or even $50 for a hair dryer, try this one.  I don't think you will be disappointed.|pos
Used this product for the first time at the Hilton in New York City. Works great. Very powerful & I like the retractable cord,very nice . Would recommend highly.Great price also.|pos
I'm really enjoying the use of this product. It heats well and I'm usually dry in 30 minutes. I love how light weight it is, because I can hold it in my lap while I either work on the computer or watch TV.|pos
I bought this dryer on 5-17-12 and it stopped working on 5-30-12. Only used it twice. It overheats way to quick when using the high setting. The dryer started smoking and then starks start flying everywhere. Not to mention it blew out my bathroom plug. I definitely don't plan on buying this brand again, definitely not worth it.|neg
I was looking for a hair dryer that was gentler on my hair since I tend to use a flat iron on it daily.  I was using one of the cheapest hair dryers you could buy and once I started using this one, there was a noticeable difference.  It's much quieter and the varied heat controls are very useful.  It's also a cute color that is very close to the picture.  It seemed a little heavy a first compared to my cheap hair dryer, but you get used to it.  And of course, it's always nice to have a retractable cord.  I'm very happy with this hair dryer so far. :)|pos
Every day I used to dread blow drying my hair. It's long and thick and after a half an hour it still wouldn't be dry. This hair dryer gets my hair completely dry in 3-4 minutes max. It has totally changed my life. I have bought one more just to have on hand. You never know how long a hair dryer will last.|pos
Bought this hair dryer over a year ago and my husband and I have used it<br />everyday since with no problems.  It is easy to fold when we travel and<br />love the fact that the cord retracts.  I decided to go ahead and order a<br />second one to have on hand when this one goes out because with my luck<br />it wouldn't be available then, and I really like it.|pos
I had been looking to purchase a blow dryer for our spare bathroom and trailer when I found this one I was so happy it has exceded all my expectations. It was such a good deal. I am very pleaswed with the product and how fast it arrived.|pos
This hair dryer is a very powerful unit that exceeds all my expectations. I am so glad I got this unit from Conair. The dryer arrived before the specified date and I use it all the time to dry my hair.|pos
I'm one of those people who reads most reviews before purchasing a product on Amazon. I understand that it seems like most of the time there is that one or two people who speak poorly about a product that the masses rave about.  It's just a blow dryer, about $80 at that, but still just a blow dryer. This product could be a good hair dryer, but the plug does not work subsequently neither does the dryer.Why I'm leaving this review is to expose the lack of commitment the seller has towards their product and customer. The seller would not respond to my emails about this broken down product in under four months. For the first 3 months the dryer worked well. Then the dryer at times would work and not work. Finally the dryer would not turn on. I cut the plug off and tested the power to the dryer without the plug. The plug is bad and so is the dryer with this plug.|neg
It was the best purchase I made in a while . It straightened out my very coaurse hair . I love how hot it gets . I don't even have to apply a flat iron to my hair no more .|pos
Great folding hair dryer for a great price.  I needed a hair dryer to take on the Fantasy carnival cruise.  The Glory had a hair dryer in the drawer but unfortunately the Fantasy did not.  It is going on another cruise this Fall on the same Fantasy.|pos
It's nice to find a home appliance that actually works as advertised. This Remington dryer does that and more.<br /><br />It's very well made. It's easy to operate. And it dries hair very fast. We've had this for a couple of months and it's held up quite well with almost daily use from someone in the household. Good value for the price, too!|pos
This helps us from having STUFF all on the top of our bathroom countertop, since we have limited counter top in this Bathroom. We had one before that hung on the wall of the bathroom, our motorhome.  Great for organization & small places.|pos
I originally used this dryer last year at a 5 star hotel in Chicago and loved it. So I asked the desk clerk if I could purchase a new one from the hotel. YES!  My daughter and I seem to want to use it at the same time, so I ordered another one so we wouldn't have to fight over it in the mornings. :-) HIGHLY RECOMMENDED because it is small, has great blowing power, has appropriate heat, folds in half, and has a retractable cord!|pos
I absolutely love this blow dryer. It works so well, and gets the job done in half the time. I highly recommend this blow dryer, I use it in the salon, and it gets my clients in and out in half the time.|pos
I'm very picky with my blowdryers. It always seems like they're either too hot, not hot enough, or don't give enough pressure to mold my hair. This blowdryer suffers from NONE of those problems. On top of the high quality drying it delivers, it is also very comfortable to hold. Most blowdryers have hard plastic handles that can slip easily (especially after a shower) but this one has a nice rubber texture to it. I've been using my Mangroomer for a couple of months now and I am thoroughly satisfied with it. Highly recommended!|pos
Personally love the product compares to the old dryer that I have. Also,good for the price - great for short hair. curl too|pos
This little hair dryer was exactly what I was looking for, small, easy to travel with, and not too loud.  I checked for other travel size type hair dryers, but found that many of them were too big and wouldn't reach from a floor plug outlet up to the mirror because of the recoiled cord.  This little hair dryer was perfect for my needs and does a great job of drying my hair and not making it frizzy as well.  I was prepared for any color to show up, but was pleased to get a white one with red details.|pos
I am satisfied with this dryer; I don't see the need for anything fancier than this. Besides, it's pink so that gives it triple bonus points in my book.|pos
After several years of daily used, my trusty Conair 1875 finally quit on me.  Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a cool setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that's supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, yeah, right).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I'm done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the salt gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it.|pos
I'm a hairstylist, and Twinturbo 3200 is one of the best blow dryer out of all brands, if anybody likes to get fast and quality style, this is the perfect product, it's powerful and last longer..... I loved it|pos
Just bought this hair dryer for my upcoming trip - I needed something with dual voltage. It arrived in approx 30 hours through Prime Shipping. Tested it out tonight and LOVED it. I have thick-course hair that generally dries moderately straight, but I straighten it to smooth it down. This hair dryer nearly eliminated my need to straighten my hair! It dried quickly and straight! No frizz, hardly any flyaways, and super soft! I'm very pleased and definitely recommend this product! Just hope it'll hold up to the English weather!|pos
It is faster compared to my old one, the cord doesn't use extra space as it rolls inside, which I find very convenient.|pos
Excellent product and frankly deserves attention<br />The experiences of this product I am relieved a lot<br /> And all my friends who saw him Aaajabu|pos
Tried this blow dryer at a hotel, went to my iPhone and ordered it immediately. I have long, curly hair and even on the slow speed, it dries my hair fast with less frizz.|pos
I've been using this hair dryer for over a year and I still love it.  The cord reel is my favorite feature.  It also has high, medium, and low heat seatings and 2 speeds.|pos
I love the hair dryer, fits the wall perfectly, cord is long enough & hangs on hook when not in use.<br />For the ones that do not like the night light on the base, you can push the test button which will turn the light off.  Then push the reset button to turn it back on &/or to use the dryer.|pos
If I had to describe my hair, I'd simply describe it as chronically curly. My old dryer used to make my hair more knotted and yuck but this dryer actually makes my hair super soft! Drying time is 50% shorter and my hair generally seems more healthy. It doesn't burn my hair and the cord doesn't tangle much. Loving this dryer! Highly recommended.|pos
Don't waste your money on this blow dryer - you will only be frustrated and end up with frizzy, over processed hair.  The brush attachment is awful and doesn't grip in your hair, you'll be brushing and brushing and get mediocre results.  I decided to give this a try after my trusty Conair shorted out - what a disappointment! Even after blow drying I would still need to flat iron in order to get out the frizz.  Will never buy this product again!|neg
It was so hard to find a blow dryer that had a lot of airflow and this one meets the price/performance ratio. I highly recommend this.|pos
I first used this hair dryer at a hotel I stayed in recently. I liked it so much that I did an online search for it and discovered that Amazon carried it. It has a nice feel in the hand, not too heavy, with a comfortable handle. I really like that it has 3 speeds. It also has a cool blast button, but I don't use that. It is also quite quiet for a hair dryer. One of the best features is the retractable cord. Now I don't have a mile of cord snaking all over my countertop and down the front of the cabinet. I bought this dryer even though I had recently bought a Revlon that I wasn't crazy about because it was too large and quite loud. Very happy with this! I hope it lasts as long as my Conair that died after 15 or so years.|pos
We had the previous model for over 5 years.  Worked every day till the heating element broke.  So we had to replace it.  New unit is only improved.  Uses the previous mounting hardware on the wall.  We expect great things for this replacement.|pos
I bought two of these dryers.  The first popped, sparked and flashed out of the box.  The second developed the same problem within a week.  Frankly, they are dangerous.  Steer clear.|neg
This hair dryer works great. I have long thin hair and I am quite happy with the performance of this dryer and its settings. The hot temperature is hot without being too burning, and the high blows just the right amount of air. I actually like using the hair dryer with the concentrator on it and that's something I haven't been able to say about any of the last other models I've owned. I also feel like it dries my hair without leaving it frizzy, but there is only so much I can judge on that since my hair is long, thin, and straight. Overall, very happy with the product!|pos
Item as advertised claims it comes with a 'concentrator', which is why I chose this particular dryer.  It did not come with the concentrator.  It's going back.|neg
I have really long hair but this dryer dries my hair very quickly..it also makes my hair a lot smoother! I would definitely recommend to others for its price and quality.|pos
IT weighs a ton.  It has no blow power and takes FOREVER to dry my hair.  Once it's dry, it's flat.  Any natural waves have just given up the ghost, regardless of hair product used.<br /><br />I hate it. And I've replaced it.  Waste of money.|neg
I first used this hair dryer at Courtyard Marriott. It worked so good and did wonders for my hair. I was thrilled to see that amazon was selling these. It dries my hair fast and gives it a silky smooth look. I highly recommend this hair dryer.|pos
I saw this dryer in Good Housekeeping magazine and decided to give it a try, even though I was pretty happy with my current 1875 watt dryer.  This one really is better!  Dries faster, and seems very gentle.  The cooling feature is great for setting curls and body.<br /><br />I ordered a second dryer for my daughter, but when it came there was an unpleasant buzzing sound when running on high speed.  I knew this wasn't right.  I contacted Amazon about the defective product, return shipping was free and easy, and a replacement arrived in two days.  Thanks, Amazon!|pos
I have been a blowdry failure all my life! Just can't seem to use a normal-size blow dryer to style my hair without blowing all the previously styled hair to smithereens. When I opened the box for this dryer and saw how small it was, I thought What, is this battery-operated?? It will take forever to dry my hair! But I have been pleasantly surprised. It is powerful enough to dry my thick hair, and lightweight enough that my arm  doesn't tire when I style for volume. I can move it around and hold it up in the air, behind my head, whatever. If you have limited arm movement or muscles that fatigue easily, this is the dryer for you. I do wish it had a cold shot button, but that is the only drawback.|pos
I bought this hair dryer for travel to England & Ireland, along with an adapter.  The dryer was advertised as dual voltage for worldwide travel.  That was a FALSE statement.  The FIRST time we plugged it in, it Fried!!!!  It was a huge waste of money.  I will NEVER by a Conair dryer again.|neg
I was extremely excited to try out this product and I have to say, I have been impressed with it. I normally set the blow dryer to it's highest and warmest setting, and I am very pleased with the performance of this dryer in that regard. It is extremely powerful, but it doesn't get too hot or overheat if I don't move it constantly, a nice feature that many other dryers I've used don't have. I don't personally use the add-on attachment, so I can't comment on it, but it seems like it would be a useful tool for those who needed that specific form of styling.|pos
Hairdryer is not as quiet as claimed, easy to handle, buttons seem to be in the wrong place, since I continually turn dryer off accidentally while attempting to dry hair.  Drying capabilities are good, I would give the item no more than a C-- have definitely had better hairdryers.  Will most likely purchase another-- much quieter one and keep this as a back up!<br />Not recommended if someone is concerned about noise levels.|neg
My old dryer (my very old dryer!) needed to be replaced and I decided for the price, this was worth a go.  Plus, this dryer was rated Top 10 on several sites I looked into.<br />Bottom line: It works. It's quiet. The cord retracts. It's not heavy (??!!). Does it do the dishes?  No, it doesn't and maybe I should complain about that.  But seriously, it's....a....hair dryer.  The one thing I can see is that if you were used to a hair dryer that just blew hot air, you might think this dryer makes your hair flatter.  It doesn't cook your cuticle so your hair does lay flatter and ultimately, feels softer.  But less damage is worth it--you can always adjust your products or hair style.  Well worth the $20 I paid.|pos
This a wonderful little dryer at a remarkably low price. It is quiet and efficient. This is a very  good BUY!!!! Recommended.|pos
powerful and very lovely to use! highly recommend! I just used it for the first time today and it dried my hair very quickly! :)|pos
We have been looking for this style of hair dryer for some time.  A similar but different brand dryer from local store was disappointing; loud, strong vibration, poorly made.  We have been very pleased with the well made Andis dryer after several weeks of use.  It is quiet, vibration free, well made with a long cord.|pos
I'm no hairdryer expert, but this fit my needs perfectly. It folds and retracts nicely and dries my hair quickly.|pos
I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  However, it stopped working after only two months of moderate use.  Disposable should be added to the product description.|neg
As my hair has gotten longer, I've suddenly seen the need for for a hairdryer.  I'm a Man, but let me just say Mangroomer is a brand.  There's no reason women can't use this dryer as well, since Male and Female hair is pretty much the same.  This unit has worked quite well for my purposes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-High power 1875W motor.<br />-3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I tend to use the lowest heat and highest speed.<br />-Cold air button to finish things off.<br />-Comfy rubber grip.<br />-Long cord.<br />-It looks cool!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not really sure the magical ion feature actually does anything.<br />-Annoying packaging.<br /><br />This hairdryer does the job and looks cool doing it.  Recommended for men or women who want to be groomered.|pos
I did quite a bit of research before pulling the trigger on a new hair dryer. I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don't tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I've dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:<br /><br />Conair 173RZ VS. Vidal Sassoon VS501<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Pros:<br />Lighter and smaller than the VS501, which is easier on my arm<br />Puts out more air than the VS501<br />Folds up for easy storage and travel<br /><br />Conair 173RZ Cons:<br />Not as hot as the VS501, but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow<br />Shorter cord than the VS501, which unless you need it can make it easier to store<br /><br />Overall Summery:<br />The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design. The color isn't my favorite, but the fact that it meets all my criteria and I can take it with me when I travel makes up for it.|pos
There is not much I require of a hair dryer, just one that dries hair quickly and has options for heat and airflow level.  I'm not sure the high priced hairdryers actually perform any better than this one which costs less than $20.  Great buy in my opinion.|pos
THE DRYER WORKED GREAT FOR MY HAIR. I SELDOMLY USED IT AND I NEVER DROPPED IT. WHILE USING IT ONE DAY, THE MOTOR EXPLODED FROM THE BACK OF THE DRYER AND HIT ME IN THE FACE. I TURNED IT ON AND HEARD A STRANGE NOISE. SO NATURALLY, I DECIDED TO TURN IT OFF TO SEE WHAT COULD BE WRONG. BEFORE I COULD TURN IT OFF, IT HAD ALREADY EXPLODED AND SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE DRYER! PIECES OF THE DRYER HIT ME IN THE FACE. QUITE HARD! I DON'T KNOW IF THE ONE I RECEIVED WAS DEFECTIVE OR IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL DRYER. CAUTION TO ALL!|neg
When I bought my first T-3 I paid $220.00 at a hair salon, i was told it was hands down, the best blow dryer. It was awesome, but after 3 years I started having problems. I certainly didn't want to pay 200.00 dollars again but the drug store dryers were not powerful enough for my hair......so my daughter encouraged me to try amazon. I never thought i would find the T-3 on amazon but to my surprise I did find it! I was able to get a brand new, perfect T-3 for 64.95 from discount jungle! I was a little nervous till I got it but it was perfect, it works better than the one I got from the salon!!! I feel like I got the deal of my life!|pos
My husband purchased this dryer for me. within a couple of uses it stopped blowing hot air. He reminds me all the time how much money he spent and how it can't be used.|neg
Confession time: I am not a man. I don't even KNOW a man who uses a hairdryer, so I don't know why this is for Men. That being said, this is the best hairdryer I have ever used. Don't ask me to explain what that Ionic setting does---the manufacturer doesn't even explain it to my satisfaction. But, somehow, it DOES WORK on my cobweb-fine, delicate, difficult, body-less, totally straight, almost-waist-length hair. I wear it long and braided so I can ignore it as much as possible, and so it doesn't fly around all the time and get tangled in stuff or end up in people's food.  I only wash it once a week because it's so darn dry---it would probably all fall out if I washed it every day. I don't perm, color, or otherwise mess with it because chemicals just destroy it. I've had the split ends of my braid knot up so badly in the wind that I've had to cut an inch or more off. Most hairdryers are really hard on my hair, so I use them as little as possible.<br /><br />I like the design of this hairdryer---it's fairly light, comfortable to hold, and the attachment nozzle is nice for focusing the air where I want it. There's nowhere my hair can fly into the works and get tangled. I use the ionic setting with the heat on high, and control the amount of hot air with the handy cool burst blue button that turns the heat off. My hair dries faster and untangles easier than it ever has in my life. Not only that, but it STAYS untangled all week. How is this possible? I don't know. I DON'T CARE!<br /><br />I thought maybe I was imagining all this, so I asked my daughter-in-law to try it. She said, That was the best experience I've ever had with any hairdryer in my whole life.<br /><br />Please don't comment that this can't possibly work and it's all unscientific and that I'm making stuff up, as someone has on one of my other reviews. For me, this hairdryer makes a positive difference (pun intended) on my hair. Now I'm going to buy one for my daughter-in-law!|pos
Performs great,  no problems.  Light is perfect brightness.  1200 watt setting works just fine.  Great space saver.  Used in hotels and great for kids bathrooms.|pos
This dryer is not harsh on my hair....love all the heat/speed levels! Excellent buy! No more digging in my travel bags with its great new color!!|pos
Hi, I just bought this product recently and I am very new to hair dryer.Can any tell me how to use this hair dryer, as whenever I plug in the power cord and wait for the coil to heat up, it not getting heated up and I am unable to use it.Is something wrong with my hair dryer? Please explain me how to use this hair dryer in detail... Your effort will be very much appreciated.<br /><br />Thank you :)|neg
I love the color! The grip is great, very easy to navigate my glorious mop of nappy hair! The cord retracts. There is a wide variety of settings for every stge of your hair (wet, damp). Great for touch-ups, too. I am very pleased with the purchase and the attachments that come with it. Great investment!|pos
if you are a cosmetologist like me you NEED a GREAT hair dryer!  I have yet to come across a GREAT hair dryer! I have had 5 hair dryers in the last 2 years and they have ALL turned to JUNK in about 3-6 months use at my shop!  I figured that I would give this dryer a try since it had a 4 year warranty I could return it for a refund if it was the same OLE dryer as the rest.<br /><br />Boy was I glad I got this dryer! the drying time is cut in half with this dryer and I DO NOT NEED to flat iron the hair after drying to smooth the frizz (oh, did I say frizz?  sorry, this dryer does not frizz the hair!). You do not even need to use any frizz control products with this dryer cause the negative ions that this dryer produces really does close down the cuticle and cause a lot less moisture loss and leaves the hair shiny and silky soft!  This dryer is a lot quieter than most dryers!  I had a client comment Wow - This dryer is really quiet!  I did not even say it was any quieter than any other dryer.  I have gotten raving comments and have been asked where I got this dryer!  All I can say is I got it from AMAZON!<br /><br />I really love this dryer LUXURY OR FERRARI just does not begin to describe this work of art!  I highly recommend this dryer for ALL the hairstylists!<br /><br />I give this dryer an  A+++++++|pos
Is it the best?  I don't know but I am really glad to have it.  Purchased at Folica when they had a $40 off special.<br /><br />I have thick medium length wavy fine hair.  Wash it 5-6 days a week at the gym.  Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.  But I am very happy with the Sedu.|pos
Used once for 2 minutes on low heat. Second use was on high,  fan stopped almost immediately but the heating element stayed on. STINK to high heaven and extremely hot. Safety Plug did NOT trip off and neither did my GFCI. BEWARE: this is very dangerous! This piece of garbage going back tomorrow. Not even worth the 8.62 I spent.|neg
I have a disability so I can only dry hair one handed.I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.Please put more in stock!I need another one to take with me on vacation!|pos
I bought this dryer based on reviews. I have had it about 2 months now and every time I use it the handle gets so hot that I actually get 1st degree burns on my palm. I am trashing this and getting a new non revlon dryer. Stay away!!!!!!|neg
This is a super dryer.  It is very powerful for the small size and low price.  It worked just fine in Ireland, Wales, and England.  At home I use it to dry my dogs.<br /><br />Update July 2013:<br />My review was not for this ProVersa Dryer.<br />I bought a dryer in Summer 2011 but it said First Class on it.  I've seen First Class dryers in hotels so I decided to buy it because it must be dependable.<br />I can't review this dryer honestly as Amazon has perversed my review of the First Class Dryer by playing switcheroo with ProVersa.  I call BS.|pos
My old faithful Conair finally died and this dryer was the replacement...and a dandy one it has turned out to be.  It dries very quickly compared to my older model and it is lighter weight and easier to handle.  No problems of any kind.  Good purchase.|pos
This small and powerful dryer is perfect for my bathroom...up and out of the way! Easy to mount! Highly recommend!|pos
I have a lot of hair and have owned a lot of hairdryers in my life.  I would have never guessed that owning a professional hair dryer could make such a difference. This thing is amazing.  It's works so much faster than any other dryer I have ever owned.  I originally started thinking about paying the big bucks for a pro dryer after reading an article on Jezebel. I had this thing on my wish list for a few months, not quite sure I wanted to spend so much for hairdryer.  I ended up buying it for myself as a birthday present -- what a great decision.<br /><br />If you have long, thick, coarse or difficult to manage hair, seriously consider stepping up to a professional dryer.|pos
I grew up using a crappy blowdryer that my mom originally bought for our cat. I have straight hair so I never really blowdry except when I need to tie my hair up in a neat bun (for work). I bought this on sale for $10 at Target and it exceeded my expectations! It's really powerful and exactly like the ones in 5-star hotels. I love that it has cold, warm and hot settings. It came with that round attachment which I've never used. The little booklet in the box shows a hair straightening attachment which was not included in mine. I don't really need it so it's not a big deal. I highly recommend this product. It is a little big but not heavy.|pos
I really wanted to love this product. It worked great for about a month, then I noticed it started sparking! Initally I thought it was because I left it on the high heat setting everytime I used it; however, the sparks began occuring more often and I could smell it burning. I still gave it benefit of the doubt and figured there was just a faulty piece in the dryer and I happened to be the lucky person who bought it, so I threw it away and bought the same hair dryer thinking this time it would work. It worked great for about two months and then it started throwing out blue sparks again! I have used the dryer at my house & while on vacation out of state and it still sparks regardless of where I plug it in. I hate to bad mouth any product from Remington because I am a fan of their other products, but I just don't see how this can just be a coincidence. When I contact Remington, I can never get through directly to someone. It's not really worth trying to get them to send me a new one--I have learned my lesson once and for all. Use at your own risk!|neg
i have curly hair. After being without a blow dryer for a long time i decided to by this one. i love thats its pink and a donation is made for each one sold but it also is the best blow dryer ever. i use the medium setting and my shoulder lenght hair is completely dry in just a few minutes. then i either straighten my hair  with my flat iron or add a little leave in conditioner spray to wear it curly. its easy to use and light weight and doesnt get too hot and fry my hair.|pos
I wondered whether it would be worth the money when I purchased this blow dryer a few years ago.  However, it didn't take me long to learn how superior this blow dryer is to all of the others I have used.  It dries my hair faster than any other blow dryer.  I'm not sure how, but my hair looks nicer too.  It doesn't make that high pitched engine sound like other driers.  I like the little red rubber tabs on the side.  You put it down and it stays where ever you put it. When I go on a trip and have to use the hotel's driers, I am instantly reminded of how much better the Remington is. The only thing that is a little bit of a negative is that it is heavier than other blow dryers.  But, it is hardly worth the mention.  This drier is well worth the extra money.|pos
First unit lasted two years and the switch gave out.  From reviews and comments online this seems to be a constant theme.  But, since we had the holes on the wall, we gave it another try.  Second one, just one one year, and flames came out of the dryer and actuallly singed hair.  One year and one month so warranty doesn't matter.  On the other hand, I am not sure I want more burnt hair.  I will have to find some other solution to hair drying.  The portable dryers we have, some well over 20 years old, seem to work when called upon.  Perhaps we have to go back to putting one in a drawer and pulling it out as we did for many years before the flame thrower.|neg
I have very thick and long hair and after having my old dryer for years, the motor was worn out and old. This new dryer is a perfect size, less bulky than my old one, and also very quiet. I don't get ringing in my ears due to the noise. It is not very heavy and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am very happy with this product.|pos
I am so glad I found this hair dryer. I was initially looking for one that had the folding handle, but was not successful at the time. This one is smaller than the big bulky types and does the same job, just as good. It's easier to store being more compact and to keep out of the way, even to pack for travel.  I've had it for a year and still like it and it works as good as the day I got it. It's not quiet, but it's not overly noisy either - just sounds like a hair dryer.|pos
This is the most horrible hair dryer I have ever owned. The hose would not stay connected to the bonnet. It kept slipping off. I have only used the dryer one time. Will not use it again. If the dryer was more expensive, I would have sent it back.|neg
I really like this blow dryer. It has a very strong motor and gets the job done quickly. The price was just right.|pos
I have to be completely honest in saying that, I don't understand why this hairdryer is solely being marketed towards men. It's a nice hairdryer and does the same job like hundreds of other hairdryers on the market. Outside of the sporty color that may seem more masculine or the fact that it's inscribed with MANGROOMER on the side of it doesn't change the functionality of the dryer itself. I would have to say that this is psychological advertising at its best! I am a woman and my favorite color in the whole wide world is red which attracted me to this hairdryer plus I needed a new one so I was very happy to get this one! My husband thinks the dryer is ugly. He has never used a hairdryer on his hair because he wears his hair close to the scalp or completely bald. I will admit that this is one of the best hairdryers that I have ever used. It is more powerful than the hairdryer that I just recently tossed into the trash. It drys my hair quickly unlike my other hairdryer.  It is also very sturdy.  I have accidentally dropped the hairdryer on several occasions and there is still not one dent, ding or scratch on the Mangroomer at all. It is definitely built like a man LOL!|pos
I think they are calling it a Mangroomer since it looks really cool. The grip is nice and feels solid to hold. The hairdryer itself does the job well and dries the hair fast. It has various heat, speed settings, a cool air button. I loved the power on this and it isn't too loud at the same time. You can also use the attachment but for me it worked well without it as well. The red and black combo really looks nice. I do recommend this hairdryer for the price and the power it delivers!|pos
This dryer is the dryer of all hair dryers!  I have long thick hair (african-american) and I have never had a perm.  All natural.  I have tried different hair dyers and all of the comb attachments would break or come off while I am trying to dry my hair.  Not only is this product worth every penny, but I love the resin pick, the color of the product and the comb hasn't slid off yet!!!!!!  I plan on buying another one soon and if you have hair that is thick or you are of mixed race, this comb is great!  The only con is that the dryer is kind of loud but trust me, you won't care once you put it to your hair. The price is great from this seller and I received the product in a week!  Very happy.|pos
Love this blowdryer. It is a bit louder than my Chi Nano and isn't as powerful but it doesn't seem to effect the drying time. Also I would love for it to have a stand but no biggie :)|pos
This is hands down the BEST dryer I have ever owned! this is the only dryer I have ever used that allows me to finish my whole head without it stopping, my other dryers stop at LEAST twice to cool down before I finish! the comb attachment had me sort of skeptical because my hair is coarse and kinky but this comb attachment works like a DREAM it literally glides through my hair better than ANY other comb attachment of any dryer I have ever used, I get so angry just thinking about the fact that this dryer has been around for years and I had no Idea! This type of hair dryer is exactly what my hair needed  and I just found out about it! I will never purchase another hair dryer other than this one again!|pos
This hairdryer is perfect. No more hunting for the hairdryer, it's right there on the wall, just like in a hotel bathroom. I've only had it for a month but so far I am very pleased.|pos
My previous blow dryer was an Ionic one and it lasted about 10 years. I don't remember the brand, but it was really expensive and high end. I think it was somewhere around $175 new. So, the other day the heat finally went out on it and I needed to replace it. This time, no question, anything other than an ionic simply won't do. Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive. As long as this one doesn't break anytime soon, I am sure I will be VERY happy with it! (No need for me to add the benefits of the ionic vs the regular blow dryer, you can find that info just about anywhere on the net). I completely recommend this product!|pos
good travel dryer. small, light and worked well for our three week trip to Italy. only needed the outlet adapter. did not need a heavy converter. still using for travel.|pos
What a huge difference this dryer has made on my hair with only using it one time!! My hair has no more frizz!! I'm so happy :-)|pos
I got this hair dryer as a gift for my daughter, especially since she would leave her home to borrow mine, which has a similar style.  She loves the results and tells me she thanks me every time someone compliments her on her hair.  My daughter and I both like the ability to hold the hair dryer as a comb or brush for drying and styling.|pos
The drier is GREAT. I don't usually review items but this drier is the best one I've ever used. For the price ($23.66), it far exceeded my expectations. Although I had never heard of this brand before, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality. It has very easy to use speed and heat settings, the low setting is just right for my fine hair, but still gets hot at that speed (unlike the Conair I was using). It's not heavy, the 'ion' technology seems to be working.. My hair dries much faster, with less frizz, higher shine and so far with less damage to my hair. Results from this drier don't even compare to my previous Conair 255R. Also WAY better than a Bed Head drier I bought a few years back. Buy this one.|pos
The pictures/description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted. I mounted it on the wall with screws (I found a wall stud for one screw location) and it is excellent.<br />Don't mount it vertically. You should mount it, with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular. This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..<br /><br />It is unfortunate, that this product is currently unavailable. I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more.. I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available.|pos
This blower dryer is the bomb. It dried my hair super fast there are three heat settings and a cool down setting, very 21st centuary.  Shipping was fast too. I love the compact size it's not too big or too small.  And as far as blow dryers go it's not nosy at all. I can finally blow dry my hair with out disturbing the nieghbors.|pos
Very nice hair blowers.  Easy to attach to bathroom wall.  Makes it very handy to use and there is no need for a place to store when you are done.|pos
This dryer can't compare at all to past hair dryers.  It is hard to adjust and very noisy.  It took me a few attempts to finally find a way to sit under this dryer without it knocking out my rollers or making me sit in very uncomfortable positions.  Hard to adjust on my own, had to have my husband fix it for me.|neg
I bought this T3 blow dryer over a year ago and just this morning had a failure with it.  I have loved this dryer and the technology it uses.  I contacted Best Buy Beauty this morning and they are replacing my dryer.  Great customer service!  Thank you Jennifer Cavanagh|pos
after having my previous blow dryer for almost 6 years, it finally died on me. i did a bit on research on some blow dryers and to be honest this one caught my eye only because the color lol i read some of the reviews and went ahead and purchased it. it was suppose to arrive on a friday and i recieved it on monday :)) that was a plus, after usuing it I LOVED IT, it was light weight, small and came with a diffuser and another gadget. i have long thick hair and my hair was dry in less than 15 minutes and it was soft and had less frizz !! love this product !|pos
I love the look of this hair dryer, so I guess they knew what they were doing when they marketed it to men. I'm not a frequent hair dryer user, but it's always good to have one around. This one is manly enough that you'll look cool using it, and can leave it laying around without your date thinking you have a live in girlfriend.<br /><br />Did I just say that?<br /><br />And yes, I suppose I should mention, it really does dry your hair. Now can we go back to talking about how cool it looks?|pos
I've always wanted a compact hair dryer that I could have on the wall.  This is one is the perfect one since I don't have a big storage area.  It makes my life much more organized and I just love it.  It works perfect!~|pos
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY AUNT AS A GIFT. SHE WAS VERY EXCITED TO USE IT FOR THE 1ST TIME AND THE DAMN THING NEVER WORKED. SO I HAD TO GET THE DRYER BACK AND MAIL IT FOR A REFUND ...NOT HAPPY AT ALL|neg
I first bought this because the gym I went to had this hair dryer and I always liked how it dried my hair.  I also figured people use the hair dryers all day long at the gym so they must last.  So when I was in the market for a new hair dryer and decided to buy the same one.  Ive used this everyday for the past 2.5 years and still works great.  The lint catcher is easy to clean out and has good excellent heat and drying power.  When this one someday wears out I will be buying the exact same one again.|pos
The first two times I used this dryer was ok. Now every time I use it the motors sounds like it is bumpi g something and about to. Low up. I was so excited to get this dryer but instead I am very disappointed.|neg
Bought this the other day and was blown away by the power.  The attachments fit nice and snug and it dries in less time than my $20 one I had.  I definitely recommend this hair dryer.  My hair never got frizzy like it does with some other dryers.  The hair dryer that I just replaced with this one, the  attachments used to fall off all the time and it was frustrating.  I also used to hit the buttons during drying and shut it off accidentally.  Not with this one.  The buttons stay in their position easily, and the attachments stay on and fit really nice.  I think this dryer is going to last a long time.|pos
The Mangroomer arrived a few weeks ago and 3 of us decided to give it a try.  Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.|pos
Like the Oster hair dryer a lot.  It is larger than my old one, but a lot more powerful.  Great choice!|pos
... and if you're not careful, she just might steal it.<br /><br />This Mangroomer Hair Dryer for Men dries my shoulder-length hair faster than any other hair dryer I've every tried (less than five minutes) -- and it does it without over-drying my hair.  I didn't need the attachment, so I can't say how well it works, but this beauty of a hair dryer is now in *my* drawer.  Oh sure, my husband can use it whenever he wants, but this is now *mine*!|pos
This is a sturdy, high-quality hair dryer.  It has all the features that my own hair dryer comes with. It has multiple heat settings, multiple speed settings, a cool blast button, an ionization button you can toggle on and off, and a removable end-cap you can use to focus the airflow.  It has good speed, nice heat, and durability.  It doesn't overheat and it dries hair very quickly, even longer hair like mine.  The only thing about this hair dryer that makes it a mangroomer is its appearance.  It looks like a power tool, so no man will be embarrassed to hang it in his bathroom where guests might see it.  In my home, my teens are using it.  It's a great hair dryer, for men or women.|pos
I was looking for a lightweight, high-power hair dryer with lots of features (high/low, warm/hot, cold shot) ... and this one surpassed expectations. It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands/sides of head. It is also very powerful without being overwhelming. It dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did. I can't think of any criticism, except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice.|pos
I bought this as a gift and it worked out amazingly! She loves the product. You would never guess that you could buy such a quality hair dryer at such a cheap price!|pos
My experiences with this hairdryer and this company are X4.  I purchased two sets of two hair dryers for my daughters for Christmas.  Each set had a travel size and a full size hair dryer.  They were $200.+  for each set.  At the time I made this purchase, reviews were pretty good and the warranty for each  hair dryer was for 4 years.  Within 6 months, both travel size dryers were no longer working.  They smelled of burning wires, and were VERY HOT!  The company REFUSED to replace them, saying they no longer made this particular model.  Before the end of the 1st year, one of the regular size dryers had gone bad as well(same hot, burning smell), and the other before 15 months was up.  Comapny wouldn't return a phone call or answer an email.  I tried many times for 3 months, finally giving up and calling the seller (QVC).  I really didn't expect them to do anything after 15 months, ( and they didn't), but I wanted to warn them about the company not standing behind the warranty that they used in their sales pitch.  They are still selling them, so this warning is for potential buyers from anywhere.  DON'T BUY T3 brand products!!!|neg
perfect size, power, and light in weight.. best of all great price.. I couldnt ask for more<br />I use it eveyday @1st I though the power was not enough.. But I was wrong this little<br />dryer packs a punch...! its so I bought another one to share with friend (as a gift) lol<br />and the price.. you cant even find 1 this low|pos
We first encountered this dryer in a hotel room.  My wife used it and immediately fell in love with it.  Small, but it packs a punch. Plenty heat and plenty air volume.  She simply had to have one since her dryer at home was getting sick.  I checked with Amazon and found the identical model we had used at the hotel.  She loves it and it has performed flawlessly for several months now.  We highly recommend this item.|pos
I read a lot of negative reviews on this dryer. I love it! It's lighter  weight than the older model and low noise. Drys my hair fast without being so hot that it burns my hair!!|pos
it is quite good in shape and it is convenient to use as it is not so big. the power of it is really nice|pos
I bought this dryer to replace my Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, which started smoking and sparking after less than a year of use. The John Frieda is much more powerful, and overall a great product. It is so strong that I can use the low setting on hot heat to get my long hair (mid-back length) dry in only a few minutes (5-10). The high setting is very, very powerful. It is relatively lightweight too. It has a nice look - the silver and purple together look sleek. The cord is very long. I would definitely recommend.|pos
I like this product. As someone who regards his hair as stuff that sits on top of my head and needs to be kept in some semblance of tidiness, a grooming product is of little interest to me. I rarely use a hair dryer when I am away from home and it's very much a matter of if it's there I'll use it; if it isn't, then that's what a towel is for.<br /><br />The Mangroomer is a pleasant surprise. The bright red and black design is appealing -- clean, bold and well-shaped. It looks good and feels good. I liked the solid construction and the firmness of the controls. Most of the features go way beyond my needs. I still don't know what all the ionization stuff means; all I want to do is dry my hair quickly and have it feel good. The Mangroomer meets my basic needs in this regard.<br /><br />The slightly higher than average price doesn't seem to me to be excessive and the design makes it worth a few extra dollars. It is definitely more attractive than all the standard bathroom beige and blandness. I did not expect to actually enjoy a hair dryer. Summary: function good enough, quality high enough; design a nice extra|pos
I did really like this hairdryer - I bought it and it worked well, was not too noisy, had some good power. But after less than a month using it 3-4 times per week for 15 minutes, it just suddenly died and no amount of resuscitation would bring it back to life! Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund including shipping - I don't know if it was just a defective one or if it is a common problem with this hair dryer - but that was the end of that. I then went nuts on a $100.00+ salon hair dryer and am quite happy now.|neg
I also ordered the Silver Bird 2000W Turbo Hair Dryer at the end of January 2012 but was sent a Black Bird 2000W Hair Dryer instead. It was obvious someone stuck the Black Bird hair dryer in a plastic bag that was sealed with regular Scotch tape and had a small label with a bar code and a description for the Silver Bird dryer.  As soon as I received it, I contacted Amazon's Customer Service via an online chat and told them they sent me the wrong item. I was sent a link for a UPS return label, which I printed out. I asked the rep if they could arrange for UPS to pick the package up since I live in a very rural area, and they were responsible for the fulfillment and shipping of the product. I was told that I would have to find a UPS drop-off point myself. (It was very frustrating dealing with the online chat rep.)  I tracked the return of the package to Amazon and waited for my refund. Six business days AFTER they received the hair dryer, I still didn't see a refund to my credit card.  This time I checked the box asking for one of Amazon's Customer Service reps to call me, which they did, immediately. This time, my experience with Customer Service rep #2 was excellent. The gentleman who helped me out was a true pro. He researched my transaction and issued a credit to my account, which hit the next day. I would never order anything from NewVo Beauty again. Fortunately, I received excellent service from Amazon's telephone reps. Beware of NewVo Beauty. I don't believe their outstanding ratings, either.|neg
First, I am a woman and I got this hairdryer for my own use (my hubby is bald).  The Mangroomer 1680XL-6 did a good job drying my long, thick hair, although not any faster than my old dryer.  Things I like about it:  adjustable heat settings and the attachable diffuser.  It is bigger and slightly heavier than my old drier, but has a good rubber grip, quiet motor, and a fun bright color scheme. I tried it with the ionic setting on and with it off and found no difference in the look of my hair with either.|pos
The Mangroomer aspect is more of a marketing thing than any realistic specification for this hairdryer. My wife loves this hairdryer and uses it all the time too. It pumps out plenty of heat on the highest setting. There are numerous options for temperature settings. I've never needed it, but I tried the cold air blast feature. This apparently sets your hair after it has been styled? I don't really understand that process, but if that's important to you - the feature does just what it says. I found that the hairdryer volume while running is pretty acceptable (not sure if I'm alone on this, but I hate really loud hair dryers). The design is attractive and I guess a little manlier than the standard hairdryer? I don't know, grasping for reasons why this is a mangroomer specifically, but yeah it looks pretty cool and not feminine. But I think you'd have to be pretty insecure to be weirded out using a feminine hairdryer anyway. I think the Negative Ion stuff is hogwash, but hey I'm not a hair scientist. Bottom line: this hairdryer makes wet hair dry.|pos
Love this dryer. Low setting left hair dry but not static like some dryers. Higher settings may be better suited for long hair. Nice color combination.|pos
My daughter purchased this and because she wanted something cheap and in-expensive but with good quality. This was perfect. It came with the Concentrator. The one negative thing I have to say is that my daughter would've liked to have something like the Universal Finger Diffuser. Other then that it has really nice settings Low Med and High with a cooler button and it isn't very heavy.|pos
I was recommended this blowdryer by a good friend, who was also recommended it by a friend. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it nice and smooth. I had my old dryer for over 4 years, and the change in my hair's texture and the amount of time it took to dry my hair was huge. I would recommend this to anyone, and I really like the look and style of it.|pos
This Hair Dryer is very convenient. Small and it has a pretty good power.  The item arrived in perfect conditions.|pos
I purchased [[ASIN:B004Q6JL04 Joico K-PAK Quadraion Pro-Dryer]] about 8 months ago, and thought it would be the answer to my needs. Well, to be fair it was for about 7 months then it started dying.<br /><br />So, I purchased this one. I really like it! It is a little louder than the Joico one but that doesn't bother me, this one works great. The buttons take a minute to get used to but they aren't a deal breaker. It dries my hair just as fast as the spendy one, makes it shiny, and has multiple heat settings. The cold shot works great as well.<br /><br />Really is a great deal for a quality dryer, I tried the best and had nothing but issues...so I would rate this one the best.<br />I can recommend [[ASIN:B004Q6LVAW Joico K-PAK Quadraion Blowdry Spray, 5.1 fl. oz.]] it works with any dryer :)|pos
Mi pelo es ondulado y necesita mucho calor para alizarlo...Este secador es simplemente PERFECTO para alizar el cabello!!Los resultados son como en el beauty salon..Definitivamente la mejor invesion que he hecho en mi pelo!!Vale cada centavo!!Me encanta!!|pos
I have only used this hair dryer one time but it was enough to know that I like it. It did in fact dry my hair faster than my old Revlon. I have long thick wavy hair and I could tell within a minute that it wasn't going to take long to get it dry.  I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.  I am very happy so far with my purchase but if anything out of the ordinary happens, I'll be sure to update my review.|pos
i was so pleased with this dryer, it gave my hair a thicker look. The volumizer works really good, makes my hair even thicker, wish it came with a comb tho, but its good, and i love it...|pos
Excellent product. It works as advertised and the power is sufficient to straighten even the most curly hair.  I recommend the product highly.|pos
This is the best blow dryer I have brought it works amazingly on my hair and my daughters hair. I have tried other blowers but they would always leave my hair fizzy and dull. But this blower leaves my hair soft, manageable and frizz free.|pos
The first time my husband used this dryer, it seemed great. It had lots of power on high. A little while after he had finished using it, he noted that the barrel stayed hot for a long time after it was off. A few days later when I was drying my daughter's hair on high power, the dryer suddenly lost power. The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite. I also noticed a smell coming from the dryer. Reading through past reviews, I'm just glad my hair dryer didn't throw off sparks or catch on fire. When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot. My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use. Don't waste your money on this hair dryer!|neg
I have thick hair that is cut into a bob. This is exactly what I was looking for in a dryer. It has high and low settings and it also has 1400 and 1600 adjustable settings. I chose to keep mine on 1400 and it dries my hair in minutes. It is also perfect for styling my hair as i do the final drying. I love the convenience of having it mounted on the wall out of the way. It does have a nice night light that is bright, but I count that as a plus for early morning trips to the bathroom when you aren't ready for a regular light.|pos
I can't believe this. I bought this dryer in a local store less than a year ago and just a few days ago, it stopped heating. It just blows cold air. I thought mine was defective so I was actually perusing Amazon looking for a replacement for this dryer when I saw it on here and all the bad reviews. I decided to stop and put in my 2 cents worth.  The switches are terribly difficult to operate. I have to use my fingernails not my fingers alone. The retractable cord doesn't operate very well. But as another reviewer said, the folding handle is great. It's the only part that works the way it should. Also the attachments are impossible to stay on. You just tap them (as you normally do while drying your hair) and they come off and go bouncing all over the floor.  Hey Revlon! I think this model needs more work!|neg
This hair dryer is the one I'm keeping after returning two others to Walmart.  It has three heat settings, and the hot is actually hot.  It's lighter than other dryers too.  It's my favorite because it's significantly quieter than the others I tried.|pos
I REALLY LIKE THIS DRYER. THE FACT THAT IT HAS A RETRACTABLE CORD IS A REAL PLUS. THE HEAT AND SPEED SETTINGS ARE ALSO GREAT.|pos
My T3 just stopped working after 3' MONTHs, 3 months !!!  I am a professional and can NOT afford for this to happen while blowdrying a clients hair.  This has NEVER, ever, happen to me with ANY other professional blowdryer !   I am taking One more chance on this product since, I have a bad shoulder &  it really is light weight & leaves the hair very smooth & shinny...   LAST CHANCE T3 !   side note: There are plenty of other blowdryers that also can do a great job !|neg
I was just using what I thought was my trusty dryer when it literally BLEW UP in my hand.  Sparks went flying and there were pieces as far as 10 ft away. The entire back of the dryer exploded.  I have never been so scared of an appliance.  I have contacted the company and have not heard back from them.  Please do not buy this- it's very dangerous!|neg
Having fine hair I find the 1875 watt hair dryers a little too forceful to be able to style my hair while drying it so I was looking for a 1600 watt hoping that it would make a difference and it did. They are hard to find so I was really happy to find this one. It's nice lightweight and even comes with some styling tools.I personally couldn't be happier!|pos
There is no way to adjust the height of the bonnet.  The high setting will burn your scalp and the low setting takes too long. And this is the top of the line???|neg
I have used this new dryer not more than 5 times in the past 3 months(since i purchased) and the RETRACTABLE CHORD IS already BROKEN. It keeps retracting even when i want to use the dryer. I have to stand very close to the plug point and I cannot dry or style my hair comfortably. Although the dryer is in working condition(as of now), the chord makes it impossible to work with. So please do not get carried away with this fancy pink color and retractable chord facility. I too read the reviews and was very excited to use this product but it was a bad experience for me. I would suggest a regular simple(long and dangling) chord dryer rather than a complex retractable. Also, i find this dryer a little bit more heavier than other dryers, making my hairstyling time very painful and also long.|neg
Unlike some hairdryer's that claim to be quiet and not blast your eardrums...This one is really quiet and has no loud pitch or squeal.  Lightweight and folds up when you need to travel.  Great design on the retractable cord..which once you have this you won't be able to ever buy one without this feature.|pos
I purchased this item for home use three years ago.  Yesterday morning after towel drying my hair, I started the dryer and a blade broke off in the turbo fan not unlike a jet engine blowing up.  There were no fragments flying around the room, it simply locked up with unmistakable fumes of wire insulation roasting. The power surge button did it's job well by instantly shutting off.<br />This little hair dryer was used daily by several people,guests and visiting relatives for three years.<br />Visitors constantly remark: Where did you get this wonderful little hair dryer?<br />I ordered two more for my home this morning.<br />It's not quiet.  The thing does scream.  It is however, remarkably fast drying hair and the night light works well.|pos
This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair. I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I'm so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would've been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.<br /><br />Again, I'm not a professional but I don't want charbroiled hair either. I'm pretty confident that won't happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I'm fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren't bad at all; that's after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.<br /><br />I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.<br /><br />I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.<br /><br />Addendum 03/15/2012<br />I've noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can't describe the way I do it (I'm not even sure I'm doing it correctly). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.|pos
This is the first electric equipment I bought from Amazon, and it is ALL beyond my expectation. I highly recommend it. If you want to buy a non-professional hair blower with professional effect, you should try this. The only thing not perfect is that the plug is a little hard to fit, but it's okay.|pos
This is a good hair dryer in a fun color.  The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  The only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky, but this is not a major problem.  Overall, I like and recommend this hair dryer.|pos
This hair dryer has a lower noise level when in use.  Many dryers have a very high pitch whine from the fan motor.  Fan was found as the dryer provided in a Hampton Inn.|pos
excellent for thick long hair , it just take me 15 min to dryhair , my hair now shiny and looks more stylist|pos
Pros: Lots of nice features; fold up handle and retracting cord. Really does make my hair feel soft and seem healthier.<br /><br />Cons: It's not as lightweight as I would have hoped or some other reviews have said. It's also not as quiet as other reviews have stated, the noise is average, not any quieter or louder than others that I have owned.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with it, especially for the $25.00 price.<br /><br />Update 04/16/13 - owned for over a year and still going strong.|pos
Hi, I commented that I get the dryer is in the photo with carecteristicas they offer, I feel cheated and very angry, because I rely on information that you published the photo in addition to the product but it is not, the dryer sent me has nothing to do with what they are offering, I feel cheated, robbed.  are a very bad sellers, they offer a product that ultimately can not sell.|neg
I have long hair that takes forever to dry. My boyfriend bought this for me for my birthday and it has taken time off of my morning routine and it also matches my curling wands! I love the pink and black design and it's much quieter than my old hair dryer. I highly recommend it!|pos
WOrks fantastic and came with a diffuser and another nozzle for straigtening! Very inexpensive and works great!  I bought one for myself and one for my mother.|pos
My wife wanted this to replace an old broken one.  It arrived on time and works as advertised with no problems so far.  She said she likes it.|pos
it's not working, never stay on the mirror. Falls down all the time in few hours, and it broke my large mirror last time. I hate it, and I am not going to use it.|neg
I'm just a guy and my needs for a good hairdryer are the following:<br />Good airflow<br />Quiet<br />Drys the hair quickly<br />This hair dryer meets all three, plus the price is right.|pos
I have very long hair so it use to take me about 20 min to dry .  I read the reviews so I thought I would take a chance What a differece With this hair dryer it only took 5 min I could not believe it def not sending this one back|pos
It's a great little hair dryer. Small footprint on wall & dries hair efficiently. What more could you ask for.|pos
This unit is quieter than others I have, and dries my hair faster--seems to have good power. I also find it comfortable to hold and the switches work smoothly.|pos
Context: I am a male, who needs a hair dryer to volumize/texturize/dry as quickly as possible in the mornings.  Pros: Does exactly what I need it to.  - Dries quickly and efficiently.  - Shapes my hair exactly the way I want it.  - Multiple modes that I switch among depending on how wet my hair is (post-shower or a little later).  - Feels nice to hold (I don't mind the weight; actually prefer heaviness).  Cons: Very few.  - Size is a bit large and non-compact.|pos
Compact, sleek and the best part is - the dual voltage that makes this the best travel companion I could ask for.  Did I mention that it works so well, that it takes me half the time it used to with my old dryer. A must buy! I'm planning to buy a couple more as gifts!|pos
This is a hair dryer with lots of heat and power, to get you ready and on your way fast! It is comfortable to hold, and works well at every setting! Love the fiery red color too, it gives a bit of energy to the morning!|pos
I bought this hairdryer because my last Conair had finally conked out after about 15 years.  I took it out of the box to test it, plugged it in, turned it on and almost immediately decided to return it.  I liked to use the hot setting on my old dryer, so I kicked the temperature setting up to hot on this one and was stunned to find that the warm setting is actually hotter than the hot setting.  The hot setting was barely warmer than the cool setting.  Something is seriously wrong with that.  Also, the cord was very difficult to retract.  I can understand why so many people say that the cord keeper function stopped working after a very short time.  This convinced me that even though a retracting cord may be convenient, it is more trouble than it is worth.|neg
I have received this product today and used it. This blower makes my hair more manageable, and dried it faster too. I have a thick hair, and although my old blower is not really old (3-4 years old) but it makes my hair  frizzy after I use it. After reading the reviews, I said that I will give it a try, and I am happy that I did. I like this product and I recommended it.   p.s. I also read in some of the reviews that they died after several months so for now I am giving it 5 stars and I will update my review if it breaks since I just used it once.|pos
I purchased this dryer 6 months ago. I have very long and thick hair - it takes me 20 minutes every morning to blow dry my hair. I have not had a problem with this product yet, and I love the folding handle and retractable cord. The retractable cord gets a little hung up at the very end, so I feed it through manually for the last couple of inches. Not a big deal in my opinion.|pos
It dries my hair quickly, is small enough to pack in my suitcase, has a retractable cord, and makes my hair incredibly silky and smooth. And you can't beat the price either. I'm never buying another dryer brand/model as long as this one is in production.|pos
high watts, nice attachments and when i purchased it was a little higher, but still worth the price.  i still use it to this day, the cheery brightens the day too.|pos
Love it, love it.  I really like how this dryer works on my hair.  It does not<br />leave it dry or fly away, but nice, shiny and lively.|pos
I was very disappointed in this hairdryer. I tried it out and it seemed to work fine; then when I went to use it, it wouldn't cut on. I smelled smoke and saw sparks. I just returned it and hope to get a replacement soon. Hopefully that one will work better.|neg
i love this hair dryer, decided to get a replacement hair dryer because my other one was dying and it took me forever to dry my hair.  this hair dryer is not only great quality but it actually dries my hair in half the time.  it looks good and very easy to use.  the motor in the dryer is not loud and annoying like some hair dryers. my only complaint is that i keep pressing the button while drying my hair. but i think once i get used to holding the dryer from the bottom, it will be fine.  if you want a good hair dryer for a great price, this is it.|pos
My wife has been wanting one of these after our first Motel several years. Now we have one of the best hair dryers we have ever had works great arrived earlier than told.|pos
I love my T3 micro featherweight luxe hair dryer.  I had used my friends sultra hair dryer and loved it... so I started to research investing in a quality hair dryer myself and decided on the T3.  I can't believe how much faster my hair dries with it and my hair is so much silkier now.  Truly frizz free!  It is very light weight and easy to use.  I actually took the time to plug in my old conair hair dryer and compare to my new T3, and it felt like someone was just blowing on my head to dry it,lol.  It really made me value my new dryer.  My hair is straighter and easier to maintain with out all the old ways I used to use to style.|pos
My daughter recommended that I buy this dryer.  I have curly hair that absorbs water and, even though my hair is short, it usually takes a long time to dry one strand.  By that time some of the other hair gets frizzy.  This dryer is a vast improvement over the many other dryers I own.  I also bought it for my daughter-in -law who has long hair and was frustrated with the drying time. Her hair is straight and she loves this product.|pos
in less than 2 years with minimal usage by just one person, this blow dryer no longer works.  Only blow cold air.  What a rip off, i have another professional dryer that is 15 years old, still blowing hot and strong.  DO not buy this one.|neg
I bought this dryer 2 months ago, and even with light use, it has now quit working. Don't buy this - it's junk.|neg
I've only used this dryer a couple of times but it is great so far. It is actually much nicer looking than in the picture, it is quieter than my last dryer, it dries my hair a bit faster than my old dryer, and as for the temperature hot is hot warm is warm and the cool is truly cool! The only downside is the cord is like 2 too short when I am trying to blow dry my daughters hair. But I guess that is more of a personal problem ha ha ha! I would recommend this dryer!|pos
I searched and researched for a new hairdryer to replace my sad, old, held-together-with-tape dryer, and based on reviews, put this one on my wish list.  Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I've used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.    Happy customer here!  Highly recommend this product!|pos
I got this dryer to replace my old one and wow does it make a difference.  My hair is so soft and shiny. I can even use this to dry my 1 year old daughter's hair and I couldn't to that with my old one because it would get too hot even on the lower setting. It dries fast without burning.  Definitely worth every cent!|pos
This is a great hair dryer! It really does seem like I have more volume, I got mine on sale otherwise I don't if the price is great if you're tight on money but I would buy it again for sure!|pos
This is the best blow-dryer I have ever owned. I am African-American with coarse natural hair. This blow dryer gets my hair dry very quickly with minimal hair loss. The design is lightweight and easy to hold plus the attachments are perfect. I find the goldish color to be kinda nice in my opinion as well. The price is competitive and it is lasting me a while. Andis might be highly underrated like a best kept secret. Most people wouldn't expect something with such a low price to work so greatly! I love this and recommend it to everyone.|pos
Conair 2000 watt hair dryer is perfect. Transaction was smooth and quick. Excellent deal, durable product powerful and easy to use. Surprised when it arrived early next morning.|pos
good product, this the second one we have owned. Highly recommend this hair dryer, it is like the one's used in hotels. The first we owned lasted 12 years of everyday use.|pos
pros: dries my hair quicker that my T3 (that i spent $180)   cons: seems a little heavier than the T3 and the cord is on the short side because it retracts.    Definitely worth it  ... will never spend big money on a hairdryer again ater using this one!!!|pos
Installed this for my wife, to try to keep the counter uncluttered. Good quality product.Very easy to mount, easy to use. Would like the cord about 1ft longer, but love it anyway. Especially like the way it shuts off when you push it back in its holder, and it has a magnetic clasp to hold it..  Very happy|pos
Well, I haven't used the product yet, but it's small size is perfect for packing. I'll try to remember to leave additional feedback on its use.|pos
Love this dryer.  First saw at hotel in San Diego.  I had to have it.  Amazon had it the cheapest on the internet. I would recommend this product.|pos
I really like this hair dryer!  I have long, fine hair that tangles easily so I use the low setting.  The high heat really isnt that hot but seems to dry my hair quickly.  The size and weight feels good in my hand.  I love the cold shot!  this is the first dryer that I have owned where cold shot means cold and not just air temp.  It sets my steam rollers in a second which again saves me time!|pos
I redid my bath. Hung this on the medicine chest. love the night light. Great performace. THE BEST BLOWER EVER!  MAX|pos
I finally replaced my old hand-me-down Conair dryer with this John Frieda dryer, and it has been like night and day!<br /><br />The significant differences are:<br /><br />- faster drying - I am pretty busy so I often find myself needing dry hair ASAP (to pick my kid up, to head outside, etc.). I haven't timed how long it takes to dry my past-shoulder length hair, but it is definitely under 5 minutes, and fast enough for me to do what I need to do.<br /><br />- leaves my hair in better condition - I always winced at using my old hairdryer because I knew I was damaging my hair in the process. I've had chronic dry hair issues and my old dryer left my hair flying every which way. I used to dry my hair only partially to lessen the damage. This dryer hasn't erased my dry hair issues completely but my hair is noticeably softer and I don't worry the way I used to about using it on my hair.<br /><br />- leaves my hair better looking - This was the biggest surprise of all. I have had such problems with my hair that I had simply resigned myself to the fact that my hair is hard-to-control. My hair is past shoulder length as mentioned, and layered. With my old dryer I absolutely needed to style my hair if I wanted to look presentable. I've spent so much money over the years trying out different brushes, rollers, etc. I could never simply wash, dry and go because with my old dryer my layers always ended up sticking out rather than curving in, and my hair would not hold any style without significant work. I was honestly shocked the first time I used the John Frieda dryer - my hair fell into a very flattering shape after 2-3 minutes of drying. I don't use a brush, don't use any of the attachments, nothing. I just dry about 90% of the way and my hair looks great. It's too bad that a month before I found this I'd already invested in a set of steam rollers. Now I won't be needing any of those tools.<br /><br />The noise level is normal for a hairdryer. I would not say it is quiet but it is not annoyingly loud. It is also quite manageable and easy to hold. I'm petite (small wrist) and I was afraid this would be a bit unwieldy, but it is lightweight enough to use without feeling at all flimpsy or cheap.<br /><br />The only fault I have found so far is the positioning of the buttons, right where my hand holds the dryer. For this reason I keep accidentally switching the air from hot to cold without wanting to. But it's a minor point given all the other advantages.eable and easy to hold.

I have never really bought anything online and this is the first review I've ever written. That said, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. I didn't know a hair dryer could *style* my hair. This product is much more powerful than my previous $15 drugstore purchase. That feature helps tame cowlicks! Overall, I have no complaints. I am very happy!!|pos
If you have thick, coarse, or frizzy hair, this hair dryer compares to no other.  I bought a different professional hair dryer a year ago for half the cost, but was never really satisfied.  This one literally cut my drying time in half, (30 minutes to 15 minutes) while leaving my hair shiny and smooth. I don't find it to be any heavier or noisier than any other hair dryer I've used.|pos
I love this hair dryer. I like the settings so I have options for how much heat I put on my hair. I also like the cold shot button so I can dry my hair without heat. I like the attachments with give me styling options and the metallic design is really sleek.|pos
item arrived promptly and so far it works as promised. dries as quickly as can be expected for the price we paid.|pos
A review from my mother-in-law:<br /><br /> My hair is thinning and this dryer gives me volume!  With my head upside down while blow drying, in just a couple of minutes, I have full, shiny and manageable hair!  The user friendly design is  great too.  The heat and speed settings are at a comfortable spot on the handle and unlike my last dryer, they stay where I set them!<br />Definitely a good purchase|pos
I just bought this blower twice the second time that I used the head of the cord melted.  This is something very dangerous I could be electrocuted.  I don't recommended this blower and also it is very difficult to communitcate with Remington products.|neg
This is a great hair dryer.  Drys my hair quickly without getting overly hot.  I like the placement of the switches so you can just use your thumb to adjust the heat and flow while you are drying and styling.|pos
I've had an older version of this hair dryer for several years now, mine is a D 2009 - so I'm thinking that's when I got it. I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond. I fell in love with this hair dryer at once, and since then I get incredibly frustrated whenever I'm at someone else's house and don't have my own dryer! It's so bad that I often tote mine with me, and refuse to travel for a long time without it. I have long hair of medium thickness and people always think it must take me forever to blow dry my hair, but it only takes about 5-10 minutes with this dryer. It still works perfect, but after years of hanging it by the loop on the cord (I hung a hook on my bathroom wall specifically for this purpose) the loop broke, so I'm debating if I want to buy a new one even though this one still works great - if so it will just mean that now I will have a spare and won't have to carry mine to my parent's house.|pos
I am quite dissapointed in this hair dryer -- its making a loud noise, & I have only used it 3 times. Its also cumbersome & heavy & too large  & the warm setting is far too hot... its like hot.  I am not a happy customer...|neg
I've had this dryer for over 1 1/2 years now and I love it. My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.|pos
This hair dryer was purchased for my daughter in law. She said it cuts hair drying time down in half and her hair has so much volume after using it. I see where others say it doesn't last very long. Her old one was this same brand and lasted over a year. And our opinion is that even if you have to replace it after a year, its worth the cost and time to do so! :)|pos
We bought one of these two years ago, for our remodeled bathroom.  Worked perfectly, so when we moved into our new house in 2011, we bought another one.  Again, works perfectly, very convenient, very well built.   Two criticisms -- the night light is TOO BRIGHT.  A dimmer on the side would be much preferred.  AND, the wall anchors that come with it really suck.  You'll need to buy a set of anchors to mount it correctly.    That said, we're buying another for our second bathroom.  It's a great unit.|pos
Bought this for my mom for Christmas. Let me tell yah it was a real chore for a man to choose a blow dryer online for a woman, but the price and weight of this item was good. I especially liked that it has a 4 year warranty.|pos
Would not recommend this product. It is heavy, loud, and difficult to use buttons. Buttons do not change positon easily. Also it seems to short out my electrical circuit. I have already replaced it. Does not dry hair faster or smoother than cheaper, lighter versions. Would not recommend.|neg
I really love this little dryer.  It is very professional looking and as others have mentioned it is feels soft and velvety to the touch. It dries my hair quickly and is not too loud, all things considered.  I would say for smoothing it is not a miracle worker, but it does much better than your cheapie dryers, and can help an amateur like me control the frizz somewhat.  I think super smoothing requires more proper technique than just a magic hair dryer.  Unfortunately I am not well versed in that technique, but with this dryer my hair doesn't look too frazzled and out of control.  My only issue with this dryer is that I have very long hair and sometimes when I am using it the hair gets sucked into the fan on the back end of the dryer.  I think this is because this dryer is smaller than my last dryer so I need to adjust for this better. Overall though, its the best quality for the price I have had in a dryer.|pos
It was a great deal, it's worth the price, my wife loves it. It is powerful, and until now is not heating in excess.|pos
Even when a small problem arose, customer service was so accommodating. Very nice dryer. Excellent customer service and very prompt responses.|pos
Baby, it's super fast (yes it is!).  I used to use the blow driers with the brush attachments, because otherwise my hair would frizz up. Well, they stopped making them so I stopped blowing my hair dry. For years.  Last week I used the Remington D3710 Fast Finish Turbo Hair Dryer because I had a party to go to and I fell in love with it and its magical defuser attachment. Not only does my hair dry before ten minutes pass, it comes out straight as a poker when I use the defuser. It's not too heavy and it's even snazzy looking. Just seeing it cheers me up.  Prince might prefer purple, but I love my little red corvette blow dryer...|pos
I have thin to thick hair and this blow dryer does the trick! it dries my hair quick and easy!no problems so far (:|pos
I had an Andis wall-mounted hairdryer previously and, after three years of almost daily use, it died.  Wanted a replacement and felt this brand was reliable and reasonably priced.  This model isn't as powerful as my other one; however, it's fine for my use...I have very short hair!  I read some of the complaints regarding difficulty mounting the unit.  Make your life easy...use two-sided tape rather than drilling holes into your cabinet.  This way you won't damage the cabinet if/when you remove it.  Yes, the nightlight is bright but if you find it objectionable, just pull out the plug when not in use.  I would definitely recommend this product.|pos
I was so tired of wimpy hairdryers that I had to buy this hairdryer after reading the other reviews.  The reviews are CORRECT.  The air that comes out of this dryer is incredible -- it dries my hair quickly, but the nice thing is that it dries your hair with air and not by baking it with intense heat-- it is hot, but not scorching.  A great purchase!|pos
My wife purchased this hairdryer 6 months ago to replace her T3 and it now only blows cold air. The heating element does not function. We contacted the seller for warranty information and never received a reply. We'd give it zero stars if that was possible.|neg
This hair dryer is made with quality. It is not heavy, not noisy, hot and offered at a good price. Amazon did a great job wtih sending me an expedited replacement order at no cost to me when my original order was lost in delivery.|pos
Este secador fue un regalo para mi esposa y le encanto. Cumple con las condiciones de un buen secador de cabello, potente, rápido y no daña. Lo recomiendo.|pos
I first saw this a couple months ago - my new hairdresser was using it. It was very quiet, despite the Ferrari engine printed on the side! I commented and they were selling them there: $260 for a $400 hairdryer.  Seemed like a deal, but a lot for a hairdryer, so I went online and found it here for $162.  It's powerful but gentle, I don't smell hair burning like with cheaper hairdryers.  The only possible negative you should know is that it's a little heavy, heavier than I'm used to with the $20 cheapo ones from Marshalls, anyway!  But I don't care - I love it.|pos
I was really impressed with this blow dryer.  I have very long thick hair and it has always taken me at least ten minutes to dry it.  This got it dry in 5 minutes.  There is a lot of power to it, and I like the fact that it does not get so hot that you can get it close to your scalp.  I also love the attatchments!  This is a great buy and worth every cent of the money. It is a very pretty color too.|pos
I am so entirely pleased with this hair dryer that I'm coming back for another one... 2 1/2 years later. I've burned through cheaper, store-bought hair dryers in the past. I bought an Andis many years ago and it was wonderful, so I bought this model in June 2009, and sadly today in December 2011 it finally fizzled out.<br /><br />The dryer works extremely quickly. I remember comparing it to the past model I had, and the reason I've stuck with Andis since because of their efficiency (and longevity). I have naturally loose-curly hair, and I use this dryer daily to straighten my hair with a round brush. It allows my hair to retain a lot of body, come out super-soft, and avoid frizz!<br /><br />While the switches on the handle are kind of in a bad place, I eventually got used to it and rarely do I accidentally turn it off. It's not hard to turn back on, so I don't see it as that big of an issue.<br /><br />I've had great customer service experience with Andis in the past as well. The plastic piece that holds the filter on the back of the dryer (at the air intake) broke and no longer functioned. I also broke one of the attachments. I called their customer service number and they replaced both items free of charge, even though I'd had the dryer for more than a year!|pos
This is a great hairdryer.  Since I have relatively short hair, I use this product primarily for my daughter (6 years old).  She like many other children is picky about who dries her hair, and how her hair is dried.  She is blessed with hair that when blow-dried looks beautiful, but unfortunately the process requires working through the many knots she routinely achieves in her hair.  I've found that this hair dryer dries her hair faster than hair dryers that I have used previously.  Its a great hair dryer, its dual action fans give out more air, thus drying hair faster than ever before.  This has been a great addition to my routine because it helps accomplish the task a lot quicker than with other hair dryers.  The hair dryer has several settings, and when on the high setting I can dry hair in less than 5 minutes, which is fantastic for me.  I've been pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer.|pos
I look for two main things with a hair dryer: the fan output and the ease of use with settings. This hair dryer worked great on both accounts!<br /><br />The turbo fan was excellent. It definitely dries your hair faster. I have fairly thick hair and it usually takes me several minutes to get my hair from wet (from the shower) to dry. The Remington D3710 cut my drying time in half. I also liked the turbo button that clicked into place so you don't have to hold it down the whole time.<br /><br />The settings are easy to figure: 3 heat and 2 speed settings with turbo. The dryer does not run hot at all. I usually like a hotter drying hair dryer because it seems to set my style easier. However, with the turbo speed, I didn't have any problems. In fact, I prefer it because it gives me more volume and doesn't leave heat damage.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the dryer is quite heavy and a little bulky (to accommodate the bigger fan). Since it takes less time, I don't mind it but if you have issues with arthritis this may be a real problem.|pos
This hair dryer works great and it is cool seeing the fans through the clear plastic but it is bigger and heavier than other hair dryers I have used; it's not outrageously bulky but it different. The attachments are nice and the power cord is sufficiently long that you aren't bound to your outlet. Overall a very good, almost professional quality, hair dryer.|pos
If you already own a hair dryer, then you're probably okay.  Unless it's an older model on the fritz.  But if you are in the market for a new dryer, then this might be the dryer for you.<br /><br />Granted you aren't going to be using the 200% power all the time (I exaggerate...I'm funny...), but when you need it, it's nice to know it's there for a quick dry.  But quick drying tends to make big bushy hair, so be careful.  Most of the time I have it on the lower or standard setting.  It works great.<br /><br />It's light, well balanced, and a pretty color!  I use it mainly for drying my dog's hair (since I have none!), but my gal uses it regularly and really likes it.<br /><br />Again buy if you need a new hair dryer, otherwise you're probably okay.  It's like trading in your car.  The Camry is running fine, so do you need the Lexus?  If the Camry is going kaput then yeah.  So the same with the hair dryer.  See? Informative and funny!  You can chuckle now.  Really.  Go ahead.|pos
the cord is convenient, but its not long enough. and the power is not strong enough (the blowing action).  i would have returned it but i was moving at the time and didnt have time to do it.|neg
A very nice hair dryer that has a diffuser for those of us with curly hair.  It's not really a mini, but it's not super huge either.  It lives up to the no frizzie reviews and dries your hair extremely fast.  There are 3 heat settings and 2 speed settings.  It dries fast even at medium heat and low speed.  There is also a cool button that cancels all heat and locks your style, it also cools your head down before you go out in the cold winter air.  It is heavier than most hair dryers.  I would buy it again.|pos
This is absolutely the best hair dryer I've ever owned!  If you have thick hair like mine then it will blow you away at how fast this dryer dries hair.  It takes half the time to dry hair as it states.  It has 2 fans, and you can take the cap off the filter to clean the hair, etc. out of it to keep it working smoothly.  Love the Red color!  It has a turbo boost if needed which I didn't.  It has a choice of settings to meet each person's like of heat and power. It has all the power a person needs to get the job done! It's a little heavy to hold but in my opinion it doesn't make your arms tired because your done before that happens.|pos
It was more than I expected, package was deluxe and product quality is super.  I am in love with my hair dryer.|pos
This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers.  It is also black and white.  I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX.  Be aware this item is not as shown.  I did not try it because it was wrong.|neg
This is the most amazing dryer! Three heat settings, two speed settings, & a turbo speed - wow! My hair gets dried fast! It's not a heavy dryer to hold either which means that it's easier to maneuver into whatever weird position you need it and with the Concentrator and Diffuser I get a nice blow out and no frizzles! One of my fav things too is that it has a filter that you can take out and clean once in a while just in case you are in a habit of spraying product while you blow like I am then you don't have to worry about gunking up the filter. Great dryer - I'll never use a hotel dryer again cause this one is traveling with me!|pos
Over 10 years ago I bought a wall mounted blow dryer after using it in a hotel while on a business trip. I loved it!  When that died, I couldn't find a dryer in any retail store that came close to its quality and durability.  Well, I have now! The Oster wall mounted dryer is easy to set up and easier to use. It's powerful, but compact. It dries my hair faster, and styles it better than any product I've used to date. No popped circuit breakers, either, so I know it uses less energy.  I won't be needing another blow dryer for the next decade. And is that ever nice!|pos
Great little inexpensive sturdy hair dryer.  Because I'm on a healthy hair journey I was looking for a hair dryer that wouldn't expose my hair to too much direct heat so the styling attachments act as a something of a barrier between the dryer and the hair and I can get my 4a/b textured hair relatively straight on medium heat a few passes using the larger if the 2 comb attachments when I need to do a trim or a length check.|pos
I bought this hair dryer based on a recommendation from Good Housekeeping and other Amazon reviews.  It's powerful, dries and styles my very thick and long hair in a fraction of the time my old hair dryer did.  Only drawback - it's a bit heavy.|pos
I love this little,lightweight hair dryer. I used it at a motel in Point Pleasant, N.J. I could not wait to purchase my own. More powerful than my other dryer with a lot more voltage.|pos
got this for over a month now. It is working great. I usually do not dry my hair, but living in NE there are a lot of snow days in the winter. I need to dry my hair before I head out. I am very satisfied with this hair dryer.|pos
My wife love this. Its very compact with a folding handle. It has an option for warm or normal air. Much more is that it's AUTO-VOLT so you can use it anywhere. A true travel dryer/styler. Highly recommended.|pos
I love this blow dryer!  I have gone through about five now, and of all of them this is the best one.  It gets my hair straighter and silky.  It always has a good shine and never leaves that static cling effect.  Also all of the attachments are great!!|pos
Bought this to replace a higher wattage hair dryer.  We would keep tripping circuit breakers with the old hair dryer (1800W, I think) since it nearly maxed out the 15a circuit.  This lower wattage hair dryer still seems to dry hair just fine and just as fast (I think fan speed has more to do with drying time than high wattage).  The textured plastic surface is easy to grip and the small size makes it easy to pack for trips.  Hightly recommended.|pos
I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer. I have long and very very thick hair, so I need a powerful dryer (I've tried many of the dryers one could find at the local Rite-Aid or CVS and even after an hour my hair would still not be entirely dry). This one does the job in about 20 minutes and it is also very small and relatively light weight. From what I've looked at, this is the strongest travel-size hair dryer out there and after taking it with me on a 3 state spanning business trip I was very glad with the fact that it was half the size and much stronger than my old Solano (which, for the record, I love, but is just really large and inconvenient to lug around in a suitcase). I also love that the dryer has a loop so that I could hang it on a hook (as my bathroom doesn't have much storage space). I would recommend this to everyone, especially if you need something you can travel with. My next purchase will be the 2400W Babyliss, once I can find it in the US.|pos
i am a hair dresser in NYC. i typically need a new blow drier ever year or so. usually i buy this one. when i haven't and i have tried other driers (and there have been many!) they are never as good as this one. if you are shopping for an at home drier this will last forever. it is very light, its fast, its hot. you can turn the ionic function off (which if you have coarser frizzier hair that is what you need anyway). it is also pretty hardy. my tools get dropped all the time. other driers crack and stop working quickly, but not this one.   you can't go wrong here, and the diffuser that goes with this drier is really great too.  enjoy!|pos
The Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic is a wonderful hair dryer.  It is very noticeably quieter than any other hair dryer I have ever had.  Compared to other dryers I have used, it leaves my long straight hair full of body and never adds static electricity.  It is definitley worth the $33.99 I paid for it.|pos
It's nice to buy a product that actully performs exactly as it was described in the marketing materials. There's definitely some valid technology that keeps your hair from frizzing out. Very happy with this unit. So far, this is the best hair dryer I've ever used.|pos
I like the hair dryer very much.  My old one was really loud.  This is not at all.  Nice color.  Very pleased I bought it.|pos
This hair dryer is the best we have found yet. It puts out a concentrated stream of air that is not too hot but drys your hair quickly. It has an easy to use mount for the dryer. Only negative is the instructions for mounting on the wall, which are backward, but once mounted it is a joy.|pos
After using this hair dryer for six months I finally got so fed up with it that I broke down and got myself a BaByliss. With the Conair the cord is too short, I do not like the angle of the handle, it`s so heavy I repeatedly bumped myself on the head with it, it`s noisy, though I wonder why because there is little air flow, and, worst of all, it does not work any better than my old non-ionic hair dryer. That one was at least quick. I have naturally straight hair, fine but lots of it, and it took me more than 10 min to blow my short style dry. I don`t even want to imagine that with long hair! In the end my hair looked so shaggy and messy that I honestly told my hair dresser to step up her game or else. Only when I recently visited my parents and used my mom`s hair dryer I realized that the cause for my chaotic mop was this hair dryer.<br />Oh, and Conair donates only ONE dollar from the sale of each hair dryer.|neg
My wife has tried many hairdryers and I couldn't believe how satisfied she was with this hair dryer...  Totally worth it!|pos
I suppose Amazon wants more than twenty word reviews so no one can just say, The product sucks!  But that is somewhat appropriate.  It is also true about the manufacturer's return policy.  I was looking for an extra long cord, and found this one. I hadn't planned on retracting the cord each time, as that seemed like it would shorten the time the dryer lasted.  But I did it once, and it was trouble to not get it past the red line.  The dryer handle was also was very large, and hard to hold without my hand cramping.  Still, I kept it, as the ionic feature seemed to be good for straightening out my curly hair. After less than two months, the power button died, and I could not turn it off.  I had to reset the outlet.  When I checked about returns, it would cost me $10.00 for the return, and they would only return half of the purchase price.  So I would wind up with around $5.00 for my trouble.  And I still wouldn't have a dryer to use, as I did not want to have it replaced.  I wonder if the company has this policy so no one will bother to return the item?|neg
Bought for our motor home. Installed easily and works great.  It is small enough to be out of the way yet has the power needed.|pos
Although this hair blower is small in size, it actually dries hair quite quickly.  Small size makes putting it out of sight after using really easy.  Love the Andis hair products|pos
I have thick hair that is almost to the bottom of my lower back (or top of my bottom, lol). Standard hair dryers max capacity that cost more took at least double the time to get my hair from wet to dry. It's amazing. I love that it has the Ionic  capability and the cool air, to help decrease the frizzie's and keep my hair style set. Not that hair that long has much style.    It did come with attachments that I have no idea what their purpose is, so those are kind of a waste.    I was initially concerned the first few days because the temp. seemed to be fluctuating, however after a few uses it smoothed out. The cord is really long, which is great because the only outlet I have in my bathroom has ruined several blow dryers by melting the plug. So I'm easily able to plug in else where an still reach the bathroom.  I'm thrilled that drying my hair is not a ten to fifteen minute ordeal, closer to five. Every minute counts when your getting ready.|pos
I am not sure if I purchased a defective dryer, but the first time I used it the motor started making a high pitched noise, and the air stopped coming out in a steady stream.  I thought maybe it was just warming up but the next time I used it, it did the same thing, with the air only coming out in puffs.  The motor was so loud, it sounded as if it were going to start smoking.|neg
Hang up wall mounted hair dryer fit right in the spot the old dryer was mounted. Powerful enough... i choice this particular dryer for the little knob that holds the cord up out of the way of countertop clutter.  And the bonus of the Night Lite ,I overlooked in the description online,  is great for nite trips to the potty. Nite lite can be shutoff if needed.  It sits nice and tidy in the room, up and out of the way of countertop.|pos
I ordered this hair dryer on Friday, and received it on Monday! Extremely fast shipper. And the hairdryer works amazing. The air heats up extremely quickly, and it dried my hair so fast without damaging it. Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised with how awesome this hair dryer is for the price!!!|pos
Excellent 100% (satisfecho por la compra de este producto, sobre todo lo rapido que fue la transaccion de la compra a traves de amazon)  Trank you!|pos
I am convinced that you need a great product to be able to straighten your hair out and have it look great.  This blow dryer has made all the differece in how fast and nice my hair blows dries straightening out!|pos
I have finely textured, shoulder-length hair, but a lot of it, so it seems to take forever to dry it.  My old dryer was pretty heavy, so much so my shoulder would begin to hurt before I could finish.  This past August, I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott while moving my son into his college dorm.  Having to pack lightly for myself, I counted on using whatever dryer the hotel provided.  When I saw how small the Andis Pro Style 1600 dryer in the hotel room was, I was skeptical of its power.  I was pleasantly surprised!  In addition to being lightweight, it was very effective.  I remarked to my husband at how quickly I was able to dry my hair (even with the Florida humidity) and that I wanted one of the dryers.  Since I could get it on Amazon for $13.99, I thought what the heck, I won't be gambling too much if it doesn't work.  I have been using it at least 3 times a week for the last 9 weeks or so without any problems. My dogs did not like it when we used the old dryer on them after a bath, but it is almost as if they like this one! Of course, I do wonder how long a $14 hairdryer will last, but my hairstylist told me Andis is a very reputable brand.  Regardless, it has been worth every penny. Highly recommend!|pos
I bought 2 of these because I thought they were very similar to what I had before.  Each lasted about 2 uses before I heard something break inside and they would no longer turn on.  No matter how low the price do not buy this hair dryer!|neg
Cons: Low speed is too low, high speed is too high.  It doesn't blow hot air for the first 5 minutes.  Speed button is hard to control quickly, I always go past the off when I want it to switch off.  It reminds me of cheap hotel blow dryers.  The back doesn't have a filter, so my hair gets stuck in it if I turn wrong.<br /><br />Pros: It was cheap.  It's lightweight.<br /><br />Just pay $3 more for the better model.|neg
John Frieda JF 1 Full Volume Hair Dryer works has major flaws and I do not recommend it. The first and most major problem is that the on/off power levels are right where your hands go, so it is constantly changing power levels. The only way around that is to hold it awkwardly. It is also very heavy and loud. Finally, I use the diffuser attachment and it constantly falls off. Today a chink of the diffuser fell off and broke. Into the garbage. I a, going to buy a new blow dryer and this junk will be thrown out.|neg
I had another  blow dryer just like this one and it finally died on me.  I went in search of it at all the local stores.  I couldn't find it, so I bought a couple other ones that I ended up returning, because I didn't like them.  Therefore, I was pretty happy when I found this close match on Amazon.  I'm very happy with it.|pos
I've been using it about two weeks now without any problems.  It blows a strong current of hot hair.  It takes up very little space because it is very tiny.  But being tiny doesn't mean it can't do the same job of a bigger dryer, because it sure does.|pos
The dryer broke after 3 months and the company won't honor the warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller.  But the company told me that for a mere 54.95 they will bend the rules replace it for me.  Steer clear.|neg
I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this, and I'm glad I listened to them. This is a powerful, easy-to-use dryer. It gets the job done, and while I use styling products, it does help make it somewhat silky smooth. Definitely recommend.|pos
Love it, love it, love it!!!  In renovating our bathrooms, we added an amenity I so appreciate in hotels.  Convenience to our over-nighters, and < in baggage weight, are both a plus to them as well. The Night light is great for the grandbabies also.  Amazon's cumulative $ point system and free shipping cannot be beat.|pos
It was a pleasure to receive this product quickly in the mail! I'm extremely pleased with the transaction and with the hair dryer! Thank you.|pos
I read about the John Frieda Full Volume Hair Dryer in a magazine, and it has more than lived up to its review.  Dries quickly, leaves hair soft, WITH NO FRIZZIES, and with lots of body.  It's made my wavy, mind-of-its-own hair behave for the first time.  I highly recommend this product.  Couldn't live without it.|pos
My wife needed a new dryer and bought this because of the reviews. Its on the bigger size compare to the smaller dryers which we normally use. But its a slightly quieter as it does not struggle for air. The handle do fold to help with storing it everyday. Over all, we like it and hope that it last longer than other Conairs which we used before.|pos
Lots of power behind the air, cool shot button AND cool setting, which I love because my old one only had the shot button which made me have to keep it held in entire time if I wanted cool air.......|pos
Got this for my wife-she LOVES it.  Did my research on which hair dryer to get-and the power on this one is incredible.  Still noisy (all hair dryers are), but less so then some of the previous high end ones she has used.|pos
I love this blow dryer, I bought it because it's the one that the lady at the salon uses.  It gets really hot fast and it has four heat settings (low-cold, high-cold, low-hot, high-hot).  I use it with a round bristle brush and it staightens my thick curly hair in less than half an hour and leaves lots of volume.  You won't regret buying it.|pos
This hair dryer is the best.  It is light weight and has two powerful heat levels.  I first used this hair dryer in a Marriott Hotel.  I loved it so much that I wrote down the name, so I could order one for myself.  So happy I did.[[ASIN:B001UE7D32 Andis 30095 Micro Turbo 1200 Watt Hair Dryer]]|pos
Got this hair dryer after my Hot tools pink zebra one broke. While it's not as cute it does dry my hair better. I am loving how light weight it is, I have long hair and sometimes my arm gets tired from being up in the air that long. But this blow dryer is very light weight and packs a punch too! It dries my hair pretty fast and cuts out some of the frizz with the ions. Overall I love it!|pos
A few months after purchasing, the HIGH setting became LOW and the dryer began shooting sparks out of it. This dryer is a fire hazard and does not function properly. Purchase at your own risk.|neg
I found this is really worth for me.I'll definitely Prefer this drier to everyone. It dries hair    just within 5min.|pos
Dryer is super quiet-at least compared to my old one. Hair dries fast and soft. I love the adjustable heat and the cold shot to set my hair.  Probably if I could change anything, I would make it have a retractable cord and the buttons are a little awkward, but it runs great and dries my hair quickly and doesn't fry it!|pos
i am grateful to still be able to find this type of dryer.  they are very hard, impossible, to find in a store on the shelf.  so thanks for letting us count on you to find items for us.|pos
I have heard about how great tourmaline hairdryers are for years, but had never tried one. I'm a total convert at this point -- the T3 dries my curly hair straight and shiny, and it weighs practically nothing. It's a quiet yet very powerful little machine.|pos
We have had walll mount hair dryers in our bathroom for over 20 years.  They work great and last a long time.  The new Andis meets my expectations for power and convenience, takes up very little space and is always easily stored.  Every family needs one!<br /><br />3/30/3013  I wish to change my review after using this product!  I bought 2 of these dryers in Sept 2011.  One was replaced under warranty after 6 months.  Both of them have now quit (one was used for 18 months, the other for 1 year).  In both cases the dryer was being used at low speed when it sudddenly smelled hot and switched to high speed.  The low speed switch apparently burned out.  I am not sure they are really safe to use after the burn smell.  I also do not like the high speed for drying my hair!  My previous wall mount dryers (both a different brand) lasted over 10 years each.  I feel this product quality is not good considering the short life of the product.  These dryers were used only about twice a week.  My dryers in the past were used daily and by a large family, so these Andis ones definitely did not last well.|pos
Hair dryer was very easy to install and looks nice on the wall.  The design of base and cord holder keeps everything in its place.  The night light is sufficently bright for late nite visits to the john.  The dryer works sufficently and as expected.|pos
HAve 2 position,warm and hot, which i really like and another feature, hight and low - u can choose what u want and best for hair. And to make nice hair style it have cool buttom which is good too. If u have thin hair - it will be perfect for u, fast dryer - what can be better :)  I recomend u this product!|pos
I really enjoyed getting my hairdryer off the countertop, but I'll have to do it with a different brand in the future. I purchased this unit 9 months ago. A few days ago, the switch stopped working for medium and high settings. I sent a note to the company via their website asking for assistance and haven't heard back from them. I'm sure they'll replace it under warranty, but why would I spend $10 in shipping for a $20 product to get what would probably be a refurbished model? I suggest you look at other options, which is what I'm going to do now.|neg
I purchased a hairdryer for over $100 from this vendor in Jan 2009.  I filled out all the warranty forms and submitted to T3 as expected. Now it's October of 2011 and it is already breaking. I was sold a POS! So when I contacted the manufacturer about the dryer no longer functioning properly, they responded via email that this vendor AND Amazon.com are not an authorized resellers of T3 products and my dryer is not covered under the warranty. Now I am royally hosed.   I highly suggest NOT purchasing any products that may require a warranty fix from any vendor like this.|neg
I attached this great dryer to my wall in the master bathroom. It is secure and so nice not to have to dig the dryer out of a drawer or from under the sink. It looks fantastic and works perfectly.|pos
I thought this blow dryer worked great and I wish I could give it more stars. I was using it today and the power switch broke. It's completely broken and now I have to throw the whole thing away. What a waste of money!|neg
I had been shopping with Amazon for about 3.5 yrs and never had one instance of a bad experience. After a lot of research, I nailed to buy this item. I was excited to see that it would get delivered in 2 days. I was eagerly waiting for it. An unknown carrier called Ensenda was chosen to deliver this to me. They took their own sweet 3 days after much of follow ups from me to deliver the item. With much expectation, I opened the item just to find out it would not work. I was doubting my own mental caliber to operate such a simple instrument, tried out different options, nothing would work. I took the drier to 4 different power points in the house, no luck. To make sure that I m not doing a mistake, I asked my roomie to check if it would work, no luck. The first thing I did next day morning was to ship this back to Amazon and got a Conair Ion Shine Ceramic 1875. Also, buyers please dont get carried away by its glossy looks, it looks stylish in the image, but looks cheap in reality. The control buttons are also bad. I m very happy with my conair, it looks pretty sophisticated with beautiful controls for just 13.28 dollars + tax. Thanks to Amazon that it forced me out of a pathetic choice. I love Amazon as always!!|neg
This dryer was purchased in August 2010 and the contriol button became stuck in October2011 and the company won't fix or replace. This dryer is a piece of junk and should have lasted for a couple years at least. Called company and got no help at all. Will not buy Jerdon products again.|neg
Wall mounted hair dryers in hotels are so convenient.  I had tried to find one to buy in regular stores but never found one.  Looked online and selected this one because the ad said this Andis was quiet. It really is much quieter than all other hand helds I've used. I have very thick hair, and this dryer does the job easily. Happy to recommend this dryer.|pos
This product is great. Very powerful and incredibly silent for all the air that it blows. Works great and I can dry my hair right after the shower, no need to wait anymore. Highly recommended.|pos
I purchased this item a few months ago because I wanted a soft bonnet dryer to replace my old dryer. The price seemed reasonable. I did not have the problems several other customers experienced with the dryer stopping and then restarting.  At least their's restarted. My unit just died on me while drying my hair. I was never able to get it restarted. I had owned the unit for only a few months so I did not think Amazon would accept a late return. The storing of the tubing, bonnet and cord was very difficult with each use. The space was too small to accomodate everything. The medium setting tended to be very hot. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to purchasing. I am now stuck without a hair dryer at home. This item was a complete waste of money. Please DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.|neg
I received this hair dryer a while back and it works wonderfully!  I used to just let my hair air dry because most dryers just take too long.  This one dries quickly and I love the multiple settings.|pos
Amazon sent product on time as promised. Dryer is a small, compact and powerful. The new black finish is nice ... not shiny black but soft matte feel to it. Gets hair dry relatively fast. Very good for use as a travel dryer or at home.|pos
This product is exactly what I wanted.  The dryer is just like the ones you find in your hotel room.  It is quick and powerful for drying your hair. Hangs nicely on the wall. I have also used it without it hanging on the wall. Much nicer to use when it is hung on the wall.  If you want a hair dryer that is powerful and small this is the one!|pos
el producto es muy bueno, no tengo ningun problema con el. ya fue utilizado y esta como lo esperaba.<br /><br />the product is very good, I have no problem with it. already been used and is as expected.|pos
This is the second Revlon hair dryer I've purchased in the last four years and both times it had the same problem -- overheating where the cord enters the handle.  This one lasted a month. The previous one -- a forty dollar item -- lasted two months and almost caused a fire while I was using it. I do not recommend Revlon hair dryers and will not purchase one again.  -----  Added on Oct 13, 2011:  Well, once it started showing overheating problems that I recognized from previous Revlon dryer, I went ahead and ordered an Andis 1600 watt which is also a very low price but pretty strong hair dryer. My previous Andis worked for several years with no problem and I loved it before it conked out on me and I would have ordered another but it was out of stock at the time, so I ordered the Revlon instead. Sigh. So, one month later I am tossing the Revlon and fortunately the Andis is back in stock now and arrived two days before my Revlon popped loudly and frizzled and fried and died an ignominious death this evening. So I had a back up in place. Thank you Andis! I will not be buying anything but Andis hair dryers from now on. The Revlon is not worth buying IMO.|neg
My daughter uses it regularly. It does a good job drying and is easy to use. She actually sets up her art table and works while drying her hair!|pos
This Andis Ionic hair dryer is not only powerful, but also smart with the foldable head and retractable chord.  If you are looking for a great, no-nonsense chord at a nice price, then get this one.|pos
This product is well made & was an excellent purchase. It is used constantly. Has variable heat setting. The night light is particularly useful in the bathroom when it's dark. I will be buying more for my other bathrooms.  Good value for money.|pos
I just paid 189.00 for this hair dryer on another site (not Amazon) because I read the reviews Amazon is NOT an authorized dealer and the problems people had with this dryer and returning it (or warranty, whatever).  My least concern was this I just wanted to be sure I was getting the Evolution and not some other model with the name Evolution  on it.  First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?  I cannot in good conscious keep a dryer that I paid almost 200 for where my vidal sassoon dryer gives off more air flow.  I have NO RESPECT for a company that LIES to every one, puts out a dryer that is even in the news and yet sells top popele the EXACT OPPOSITE>?  Why are not you all saying the truth.  I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.  But I also bought an 1875 BioIonic dryer and it blows stronger and harder than this piece of garbage.  AND its cool button stays cool without holding it down.  The only positive of this dryer is light weight.  But I can get that at the local drug store for 30.00  Pleaswe people, THINK before you write reviews and be honest.  I have to believe these sites are deceptive becau8se I have the dryer, I used it and it is clearly and no mistake or even maybe..THIS IS CLEARLY NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS, so light air flow I thought my electric ay be the problem.  So light it didnt burn my skin on highest hot setting up agaqinst my arm.  Are you kidding me people?  This is NOT A DRYER WORTH $50.00.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE and I for one will never EVER trust this company again. They have wasted my money, time and now I have to return this piece of garbage.  I can't believe the LIE of telling people waht a great piece of workmanship?  What is so great?  It is light, plastic, 1600 watt cheap deryer.  That's it.|neg
I got this dryer for my wife as she has fine, relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage (in the past I heard many complaints). Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair.

This is my second hair blower of the exact same model. (Conair Ionic Conditioning Pro Style 1875-Watt Hair Dryer)[[ASIN:B00005O0MZ Conair Ionic Conditioning Pro Style 1875-Watt Hair Dryer]]  I would by it again.|pos
I ordered my hair dryer for one day shipping;I received have used it and give it 5 stars... it works fine..no issues..I have small hands and this is lightweight enough it doesnt tire my hands... took like 5 minutes to dry my hair and it is thick and holds water... for $20 this is perfect!|pos
The Hair Dryer it is an excelen product, it works properly, so far so good i recommend the Andis 82005.|pos
I first tried this dryer at a time share. I was so impressed with how fast it dried my hair that I bought one and mounted it on the wall in my bathroom at home. Now it's always handy to grab, and it doubles as a night light. It just plugs in; no wiring involved. This is my second purchase; it was a birthday gift for a girlfriend. She is equally delighted by this dryer's speed.|pos
I am so glad my other dryer bit the dust! This Dryer is the nicest one I have ever owned, It dries my hair quickly without blowing like a tornado and my hair is a whole lot less frizzy!|pos
Exactly as described.  Powerful dryer.  Only used it two days so far, but seems to have cut my drying time.  Lighter weight than my old one.  Overall would recommend.|pos
I love this. I've had it about 6 months now and it works very well. I like that the filter easily comes out and I just really love the pink. Good product.|pos
The FHI Nano Salon Pro 2000 Hair Dryer - Onyx Black was shipped soon after i ordered it. I am a happy customer. I will never buy anything less that than 2000 Watt again. It does not dry out my hair. It is very powerful though so make sure you use Mocorran Oil or at least a comparable oil to mosturize your hair.|pos
This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.|pos
This blow dryer doesn't have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I've noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It's only a matter or time before it's shorting out.|neg
My favorite blow dryer finally died, so I was forced to buy a new one. I am so glad I did. This blow dryer dries my super thick, long hair way faster than any other blow dryer. And I think it looks shinier and straighter too. The pink color is pretty, and makes it easy to find in my pile of hair instruments. The retractable cord is so nice, it doesn't get tangled in with my 3 curling irons and flat iron. (I wish they had the retractable cord too!). And the cord doesn't retract too fast and hit you in the hand. Great, salon-quality blow dryer for a fraction of the cost.|pos
OMG!!! This is the hair dryer for you. It straightens your hair especially if you have very very curly twisted hair, you'll get it pin straight with this dryer. The Hot setting is hot but it doesn't dry out or burn your hair. It is just soooo worth the money. I've had mine since 2008 and it still runs like the first day I bought it. I've taken it traveling with me (yes it is big - i just don't care because I can't live without it) and any of those cheap hotel dryers, burn my hair so much. No matter what, my hair comes out looking awesome from it. Just buy it.. you won't regret it.|pos
My wife described what she wanted. Found what she wanted at Amazon. It was an easy install and we're both happy!|pos
The hand grip gets too hot to hold after about 2 minutes.  Not like toasty warm - HOT!    It is heavy and the buttons are located in a bad spot.  Don't bother.|neg
OK, I never write reviews, but this hair dryer is so great, I just had to. It looks very basic, but it is everything you could want in a hair dryer and more. It is powerful, quiet, dries my hair in a flash, and from the very first time I used it, it made my hair amazingly soft and shiny. I didn't even know a hair dryer could make that much difference! This is hands down the best hair dryer I have ever used.|pos
I love this hair dryer! I live in a college dorm and share this dryer with my roommate and it's working perfectly!|pos
the design is simple and nothing special but it is damn powerful and works great. that is all you need from a blow dryer!!|pos
First of all, while Conair may want you to think that this Infinitpro hairdryer is travel-oriented by designing the handle to neatly fold and also including a tote, this hairdryer is actually quite bulky in size and not exactly lightweight. Having said that, there is nothing to dislike about it once you are settled on using it at home. At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers. It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow. The motor seems hard-working enough that I have never experienced any overheating issues. Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair. Perhaps it's my hair, but in practice, I don't notice any difference from my existing hairdryer I bought several years back from a brand starting V-S.    Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine. However, don't expect any novelty.|pos
I got this dryer and immediately turned it over to my wife. She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.<br /><br />The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn't too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.<br /><br />The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.<br /><br />After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer. I can confirm this as well, it feels softer to me and I notice it is less frizzy.<br /><br />I'm sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends.|pos
This is the third Andis hang-up dryer I've had.  The first two were great--worked for years.  I bought this one on June 10, 2011.  It lasted until September 8, 2011. It's too late to return it now of course.  So I'm out the money and out of a hair dryer.  Very disappointed!|neg
It was very nice when it was working, small, powerful, folds in half, cord retracts, etc. After 8 months, it made loud sounds and burning smell. I dis-assambled the dyer and found a small internal plastic piece broke and got into heating element. My other dryers lasted much longer than this one. I'm not buying this model ever again.|neg
This is absolutely fabulous! Very lightweight and compact when it folds. Perfect for travel. Cheaper than the retail stores. Great product for the money...an awesome color too!|pos
Ordered this dryer about a year ago from another site.  Was my first time buying a professional dryer (had used drug store brands before).  The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  It's a bit on the heavy side, and doesn't have that grip coating that some of the other brands have. I give it one star because I was using it two weeks ago and it caught on fire.  Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  I contacted customer service through their website but they didn't respond at all.  I don't think it's designed to handle the heat it puts out.  Nevertheless, I'm out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  Will not buy this one again, but will look for one that's comparable.|neg
This is probably the worst hairdryer I have purchased in my 31 years of living. It is super heavy and doesn't even blow hot air. I would not recommend and am super sad because I threw the box away and cannot return it. Based on all the positive reviews, I thought I would love it, but I was VERY wrong.|neg
This is my second of this particular hair dryer.  But the first one lasted 10 years which is amazing.  Since I couldn't be without a hairdryer, I bought another one.  However, I sent in the old one to Elchim for repair.  On their website it said the repair was $20.  That was correct and for $20 I now have a 2nd hairdryer ... not that I need it since this product lives up to the hype.  This is the hairdryer my hairdresser uses and swears by.  I highly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 1800 Watt Classic Hair Dryer!|pos
Great blow dryer! It takes half the time to blow dry my hair like my old one did and takes a lot of the frizz off too. I LOVE this blow dryer. Highly recommend it. Shipped Fast!!|pos
This is a professional quality dryer and dries my hair more quickly than any other one I've owned, and it does it quietly.  It's also very lightweight and therefore easy on my arms because I blow my hair out every morning.  I told my hair stylist what I bought and she said it should easily last me 5 years.  Great feedback on the seller, too.  My order came quickly and as described. New in box.|pos
This product works great. It dries my hair extremely fast and does not leave it frizzy-that's a plus to someone with curly hair!|pos
got this Conair Wallmount hair dryer about a month ago to replace the one we had for about 15 years that finally blew up. It's the most convenient dryer you can own. Didn't even have to replace the wall mount bracket. New unit was exactly the same as the old. But - gotta say I'm really glad we kept the old unit. The rear filter screen on the new unit fell right off out of the box. The 2 little tabs that snap the screen onto the main housing were like melted smooth and could not be fixed. But the screen on the old unit was an exact match. So - snap-off, snap-on, and viola, back in business. Lucky for us. And Amazon. Or they'd have to pay for an exchange. And we'd be stuck using a clunky, 10 pound albatross dryer for bout a week or so. Amazon's delivery was 1-2 days quicker than I expected. Good price too. Oh, the built in night light is real handy too. Worked great for at least 15 years.|pos
[[VIDEOID:mo20UFHT4C35874]]The John Frieda JF1 Full Volume Hair Dryer is one heck of a hair dryer. It is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine. While it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />Notes-<br /><br /> - Heats up very quickly<br /> - Long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - The back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - It is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - Nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - Three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts (watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker)<br /><br />Final Verdict - This is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years. What some of the features are quite common this is still a hair dryer that should be seriously considered by anyone looking to make a purchase.<br /><br />4 1/2 Stars|pos
This is a very nice hairdryer. My wife and daughters have many, and this one has quickly become the default. When I asked them why, I got the shoulder roll and I dunno. I like it. So there you go, about the best one can say for a nice green folding hairdryer in this price range. It works, it's lightweight, and gets the job done. Great for traveling.|pos
This is a very nice hairdryer.  It is lightweight and I love that the cord is stored inside and the handle folds.  It is not overpowering and dries my hair very quickly.  I would highly recommend it.  It is easy to pack if you want to take it with you on a trip.|pos
The reason I bought this hair dryer is because of the retractable cord and the folding handle. The fact that it's a great dryer and ionic was a plus. My only complaint is the cord does not always retract back into the dryer. You have to pull it out and try again. If you're not careful and pull too much it will be stuck out permanently. This happened to me . I tried taking apart the dryer to fix it but ended up throwing the blow dryer away because I couldn't get it back together. I bought another one and now I am more careful.|pos
i think that the hair dryer is ok...i just like at picture! is not bad for the cost... is great  :D|pos
This is a very good qaulity hair dryer.  It is light weight, has plenty of power and yet is incredibly quiet.  Much better than a previous version that had the power but also the added weight.  The Andis 82005 closes the gap between merely a consumer product and a professional dryer, but retains a reasonable price.|pos
The product works perfectly. Other dryers suck my wifes hair into the intake, very fine hair. This dryer does not do that. When she is happy so am|pos
I would not purchase this item again from Amazon.  This dryer stopped working within 6 months of purchase which is very unfortunate given how much it costs.|neg
We were traveling and used one of these wall mounted hair driers at a hotel. We loved how the product worked so, once home, we purchased one.    Well, the product switch failed in the first 4 months and we contacted the manufacturer. They were nice enough and had us ship it back and sent us a warranty replacement right away. The replacement lasted about the same amount of time, and has the same failure, the switch went bad.     For the low price of the product $23.00 I don't think it's worth sending a second one back for warranty replacement. Shipping two units back is going to cost more than the original product.    Really nice item, I wish that they made it of quality parts I would surely pay 2-3 times the price to get one that will last longer than a couple of months.    Stay away from this item, seems like they have a design flaw in it. Two with the same switch failure in the same amount of time?|neg
i am a hairdresser for 20 years, i've had tried so many different blow-dryers but this works wonders on every hair types,no other blow-dryer make the hair silky and shiny like silver bird,but it will not last long ,like in two months it will brake, every two or three months i buy new one as i did not find a better blow-dryer i will keep buying it..|pos
Very happy with product - very quite operationally. It was a bit tricky to mount on the wall, but that was probably just me.|pos
Actually, I really loved this dryer. It made my hair look super sleek and shiny, dried fast and was very convenient to use. Unfortunately, it broke 2 months and one week after I received it. Basically, I'd used it just shy of two months and I don't dry my hair every day, so we're not talking two months of daily use. The heating element stopped working and now it only blows cold air. Of course, in order to get it repaired I now have to ship it to Florida and also pay them $10 to repair it and ship it back. Seriously, just skip this item and save yourself the trouble. Would be fine if it worked, but a product that doesn't make it even two months just isn't worth the time or money.|neg
This is a first class hair dryer.<br />Well built. Looks good and performs better.<br />The 1800+ watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units.<br />The only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn't very portable. No retracting power cords, no folding handles. But it isn't meant to be portable. Most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit.<br /><br />This dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two. It has three attachments, one is a diffuser (T3 charges an extra $20-30 JUST for their diffuser alone) to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance (works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing).<br /><br />It also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then fixing your hair in that position. I find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well.<br /><br />Finally, it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction. Some have criticized it as not having a metal body. It disagree, A metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present, which is where many people use their hair dryers.<br /><br />So not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom. Pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician, not yourself, so the dangers are minimized a great deal.<br /><br />If you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices ($120-200) they cost, this is the dryer for you.|pos
My hairdresser uses this hair dryer and I asked her about it since it always leaves my hair so impeccably styled.  I went ahead and ordered it here and I'm very happy with it.  Elchim is solid, yet lightweight, dries hair extremely fast, is surprisingly quiet,  and it leaves my hair smooth and glossy.  Super long cord is convenient, plus its beautiful!  It looks like a high-performance sports car.|pos
This hair dryer is reasonably priced for the quality of the product. The sleek design, quiet operation, and versatile settings were what I was looking for in a replacement hair dryer- and this product delivers. I've only used it twice and am already in love with it.|pos
This dryer worked fine enough for about a month after I bought it from Target - maybe a little slower than my normal drying time, but overall it was fine. I used it around three times a week in the morning. Went to plug it in yesterday and turned it on, and nothing happened but a tiny little pop. Since then I've tried resetting the switch on the plug itself as well as tried various outlets around the house. Something seems to have shorted out in it. I figured a hair dryer was a hair dryer and the $20 one should work just as well, but after this experience and after using better ones that my friends have had serve them well for several years and dry my hair more quickly, I think I'll pony up the extra $20 and save myself the headache of having to buy another hair dryer in the near future. It's possible mine was just defective, but even if it hadn't gone out on me, I probably would have gotten a nicer dryer for myself as a treat at some point anyway, knowing how often I use blow dryers and how much better they work on my thicker hair.|neg
I purchased this blow dryer and was initially happy with it until it EXPLODED IN MY HAND while I was drying my hair.  I first felt a weird sensation going up my arm and then a huge hot stab in my back right before the dryer EXPLODED IN MY HAND, with pieces flying everywhere the motor was still running and I could not release it from my grip.  It hurt so bad and feels like my insides in my back are on fire!  Not only am I in pain, it scared me pretty bad!  I will be getting a completely different dryer now. I will never purchase another Andis dryer!|neg
This is by far the best hairdryer I have ever used. I have a VERY sensitive scalp and after using my sisters hairdryer once I had a blistery rash on the back of my head, I never want to go through that again! This hairdryer BLOWS teehee, strong enough for my thick hair, distributes enough heat so I don't have to get close to my scalp at all. The back pops off so you can clean it to keep the air circulation as strong as the first use, also you can't beat the price! Great product.|pos
This is one sweet Hairdryer, stylish, well made and looks well built. I got the whole family to try this out and everyone likes it.<br /><br />They loved the attachment that helps with frizzled hair and another attachment that seems to give a flat blast out of the dryer.<br />It has great controls, hot and warm, with three speed for the fan. It can also be used to blow cold air with a trigger type button under the blower section.<br />The cable is long enough and also worth mentioning is the neat box it came in. The style is quite interesting but not overdone and it sure catches the eyes of my kids friends who frequently come over to help each other with their hair styles.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with this hair dryer, it does what it should with ease, style and power!|pos
I'm sooo glad I bought this blow dryer, it gets my African American hair really straight and makes flat ironing 10 times easier! The comb attachment is the best part, next to the hot and cool switches you can flip to the position you want without having to hold them down. Buy this blow dryer and you won't want another one.|pos
I have been using this blow dryer for about 2 months now and I love it.  It dries my hair very quickly and the attachments stay put and do not fall off.  I can understand why some of the other reviews say the cool button gets in the way.  When I first starting using the dryer, I accidentally hit the cool button but I have easily adjusted how I hold the dryer so this no longer happens.  That would be my only complaint with the dryer.  Other than that, I love it - my hair looks great, it takes me much less time to dry my hair, and it's not too heavy.  I am happy with my purchase.|pos
I wanted a hairdryer that has warm and cool settings and not just hot and hotter.  I bought it to dry my little Japanese Chin after her bath.  She hates to be wet and the Conair dries her in about 10 minutes.|pos
This hair blow dryer is superior to the one I now own.  I particularly like the titanium ceramic coated grill and the two concentrators.  It has plenty of power, 1875 watts, and is lightweight.  I also find it advantageous to have 3 heat and 2 speed settings.  I was not familiar with this brand, but am impressed.|pos
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE WITCH HAS A LOT OF HAIR AND IS VERY PICKY ON WHAT SHE USES FOR IT. SHE LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER MORE THAN THE ONE IVE BOUGHT IN THE PAST,WHICH WERE REALLY EXPENSIVE.THIS IS A GREAT BUY,AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.|pos
This is a really good hairdryer.  It is solidly constructed, has three (not two) temperatures.  The little door on the back for clearing the filter is hinged rather than detachable.  It is nicely balanced in the hand.  It comes with the usual attachments, which I don't use so can't judge.<br /><br />It dried my short hair in about 15 seconds.  It dried my visiting sister's long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.  This is partly attributable to the 1875 watt motor, but I've had another 1875-watt dryer that was less powerful.<br /><br />The virtues come with two possible vices - this thing is heavy, and it doesn't have a retractable cord.  Only the first is a problem for me, as retractable cords add yet more weight and the storage area for them unbalances the dryer in use.<br /><br />Of course it is on the expensive side.  You can get a cheapo hairdryer for $15 or a good one for $30 - $35.  You'll have to decide whether the quality and the features are worth the extra cost.  This one will last longer than your $15 jobbie, and it really does a better faster job.  It's also fashionably pretty if you like the current vogue for shiny chromy things.<br /><br />Mske your own judgement on cost/benefit, but I can testify that you won't be wasting your money.|pos
I've only used this dryer a few times,as it is my travel dryer but I love it.  The ionic feature works even better than my regular ionic dryer in smoothing the hair. The three speeds are wonderful and very hard to find for a travel dryer.  It's a little bigger than most travel dryers but folds up nice and compactly.  Great product at a good price.|pos
This blow dryer is great.  Really leaves my hair soft, shiny & frizz free.  Great value for the price.  Would highly recommend.|pos
Why is this hair dryer better than your average cheapie dryer? Well, most importantly, it's 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly. I have shoulder length, straight, fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes. I was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first, but I have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer. What I like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities. One controls the high/low/off settings and the other controls the hot/warm/cold. It's nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices. I usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings. (Some day I'll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute, but until then, I need a dryer like this!) It also has a cool button so when you're styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first, and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it. This works so well and so quickly, that it's one of the first hair dryers that I can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way I like it.<br /><br />This dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple/blue racing stripe down the side. The cord is gray. I guess what my hair dryer looks like isn't that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz? It comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow. The size of this dryer is pretty substantial, but it isn't too heavy, it's just a nice weight. I would say it's about average as far as noise goes. I've actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one. All in all it's an excellent dryer that does exactly what I want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full.|pos
I love this hair-dryer. First saw it in a hotel and was like woah no cord - so I ordered one and have been using it for over 2 years now. Works perfectly. Stores small, has plenty of power.<br /><br />Now I am curious if I can find a diffuser attachment for it!? Anybody know?<br /><br />M|pos
I was looking for something inexpensive for our vacation home so we could put in all the bathrooms.  Bought 3 of these and very happy, works better than the more expensive ones.  Have not had any problems thus far and works great.<br /><br />Edit:  Dropped this to one star.  In a year 2 out of the 3 I have bought failed.  One sounds like a bearing failing and the other won't get hot anymore.  Basically they are cheap for a reason.  One that failed, even thought a year old, was only used maybe 10 times.|neg
This is an amazing blow dryer. Seriously, I have spent money on models that cost tons more and this has to be the best blow dryer I have ever used. I have extremely thick, coarse hair. They could use it to reinforce the Eiffel Tower's structure. Having hair like this usually means a lot of time and a lot of background music spent in front of the mirror. But with the JF1, I had great results and a true cut down in the time I spent on my hair. And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn't feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend the JF1. It is light weight, not as gigantic as it may seem , a great price point, and does a wonderful job. What more can you ask for?!|pos
We used this blowdryer in a hotel and liked it.  Couldn't find it in any stores so I ordered it from amazon.  After we got it my husband told me to order another one for a back up and I somehow made two orders.  I let my daughter use one and we still have one put up for a back up.|pos
My first impression of this hair dryer is its heft. It is not overwhelming, of course, but feels significantly more substantial than the usual plastic-laden blowers. It looks substantial too, with no cheap-looking material anywhere.<br /><br />All the normal functions are there. The top button controls hot/warm/cold, while the second button has the high/low/off settings. The electric plug is shock-proof. And a quick cold button is placed directly under the index finger.<br /><br />Once turned on, the motor immediately makes a statement of its superior quality with its calm low-frequency whirl and the strong yet steady airflow. In the long run, this should be what reminds the owner that he/she has gotten his/her money's worth. The air filter in the back of the unit is sturdy and easy to clean. At 1875W, the heat should be able to satisfy anyone.<br /><br />Overall, the quality and design seem more than enough to justify the price. The only remaining question is longevity. But time will tell.|pos
This is the best hair dryer I've ever had:<br /><br />The size is not too large or too long--the picture makes it look larger than it actually is. It is light-weight. The handle provides a perfect grip. The motor cools down very quickly and the casing does not retain heat.<br /><br />The buttons are all you could possibly ask for--and they are very conveniently located right on the handle where your fingers wrap around it. You don't have to shift your grip or stop what you are doing to change a heat setting or blow setting. Don't think that your fingers could accidently trip a botton: They are raised buttons and have a definite angle and curve and your fingers have to purposefully push them one way or the other to make changes. The cold buttom works very quickly, too.<br /><br />There is a loop for hanging, a safety plug and a long cord.<br /><br />It has the normal attachments, PLUS a pretty nifty one that is suited for nice, long, fine hair. It will be able to help lift a large section of hair and shoot many channels of air into the section.<br /><br />Last, but not least, it is a beautiful thing to look at. The box it comes in is classy, too! I got goose bumps when I first took it out of the box--no kidding!|pos
I can't believe someone didn't think of this sooner! Best product I have bought in a very long time. Love having two hand to manipulate my hair how I want it. I am very pleased with the strength of hold the suction cup has on my mirror, the whole thing feels very sturdy!|pos
I like the fact that the dryer is very light weight, but I think I have used toy versions that blow harder. OMG.... I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt, and use it in the salon, and it caused me to run way behind. Every client I gave up after 15-30 min and used another dryer. I think it is comparable to using a diffuser to get a strait sleek look.... unfortunately I'm not impressed. I'm sending it back.|neg
its been a month and the hair dryer stop working, dont know what happen it just stop working and letting me hair wet|neg
I have had a yellow bird blow dryer since 1976. I replaced mine 7/2011 (35 years).  So you can see this powerful, durable, and efficient dryer is worth it's money and more.  I think I spent $15.00 on it back in '76 and that averages out to be $.43 cents per year for my investment.  No wonder it is hard (or non-existent) to find in beauty stores, online, and on Conair's website (it is not available on their website).    I love all of the settings from cold to very hot.  It comes with a comb (I don't use it anymore since I have dreadlocks) and a muzzle that narrows at the tip.      I would also recommend this model to any beauty salon because it holds up.|pos
This hair dryer is much smaller than I expected.  The smaller size makes using the nozzles much easier for those of us that don't have chimpanzee arms!  The machine is also really quiet and efficient.|pos
All I need is a basic hair dryer with several heat settings.  This one suits my needs perfectly.  Reasonable price for a good product.|pos
I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers.  I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it.  I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32.  After using it once I am SO happy with it.  It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn't even a bad dryer to begin with).  My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron.  I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4 Flat Iron [[ASIN:B001LF4G4Y Remington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4 Wide Plates]], and LOVE it just as much.  Between the two items (and a little macadamia nut oil) I finish my long, difficult hair in about 15 minutes, and it's smoother than ever, and even holds better in the humidity.  It's amazing, I can't see any reason to spend more.|pos
Since I purchased this hair dryer my hair has never been in worse shape than now.....It caused the top of my hair to break off in several different places.  The A/C motor does not help!!! I'm going back to Conair!! Never had a problem with them!!! I am devistated!!! Do NOT buy this product!!!|neg
This is the second one of this model my wife owned.  The blower fan severed off the spindal on the last one we had.  Hopefully, it won't happen again.  Regardless, we were very happy with the price on Amazon.  The items was over $80 dollars in the salon when she bought it about a year ago.  The dryer appears to be very heavy duty and good enough to be used at the hair salons.|pos
I came across this while staying at a Best Western. It impressed me there immediately. I love how this little guy packs a big punch in a little package. I wanted something that isn't monstrous and a labor to hold up to use. Also it doesn't take up much wall real estate (a big plus). The night light is a neat feature and won't create a distracting moon glow that will bleed into the bedroom. It also doesn't demand any quirky requirement to place it back in its mount. It easily snaps right back in without any trouble unlike you find with some cordless tool mounts.|pos
Product arrived very poorly packed.  The item was purchased new but looks like a refurbished/used blow dryer.  Will be expected damage and low or no life expectancy.  Would like a new one!  Very disappointed with my purchase![[ASIN:B000LQB5YS T3 Bespoke Labs 83888-SE Special Edition Evolution Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]|neg
This dryer is perfect for those with medium to short length cuts. If you have a 3 foot long mane of thick, beautiful hair or a maybe pile of the dredds, forget this one, that's not the intention. Wall mount is very convenient and appealing for guests. The price is good, it's easy to install and is quite functional.|pos
Pros: Dries hair. Folds in half.     Cons: Awkward buttons that won't budge at first, then leap past the desired setting. Retractable cord should be called stuffable cord. Stopped working after 6 months.|neg
I loved the idea of a hair dryer with a retractable cord, and I have always had success with Conair in the past, so I was so disappointed when I started using the Cord Keeper and found it was just too loud to use.  I literally had to put my finger in my left ear to keep it from crackling when I used this dryer.  I mentioned that I had to take a hair dryer back to the store when my son and daughter-in-law were visiting, and they said they had a hair dryer that was too loud too.  It turns out it was the SAME model!|neg
I absolutely loved this dryer. It was very nice and hot - and quit working at about 2 weeks. There was an electrical smell as if wires were burning, then it stopped working. Total fail. It's a dangerous dryer based on other reviews and my own personal experience plus a waste of the money spent on it.|neg
The best hair dryer Ive owned. It has super power and I love that it came with attachments! A must have.|pos
I read numerous reviews on hair dryers and picked this one. It's easy to hold because of the rubberized grip. Excellent selection of heat and speed settings which are simple to control on the handle. I have fairly straight hair and it leaves my hair soft and shiny. Hopefully it will last several years.|pos
No other hair dryer could touch the amazing job that this one does in half the time with no frizz! Love it!|pos
This hair dryer is larger than I expected as reviews led me to believe that it was small and light, but it works very well on both low, medium and high heat and is satisfactory.|pos
I don't blow dry my hair everyday, so it hasn't gotten a good solid workout like ones I've used in the past.  That being said, I do like this hairdryer.  It is easy to travel with and doesn't weigh a ton - can easily hold it with one hand without your wrist tiring, while the other hand is styling with a brush.  The retractable cord is still working although at times it takes several tries to get it to completely retract now.  Worked very well when I first received it. Only started having trouble with that part over the past several months.  The control is a single control where the heat setting and volume of air setting are the same (low air flow and cooler air, highest air flow with highest heat.) If you want separate air flow and heat settings, this isn't the dryer for you.|pos
I purchased this dryer because of the features that it offered (retractable cord, folds for storage, multiple heat and power options) which would be great - if I could turn it on and off! As it is, I fight the controls which makes it impossible to use. And quiet? Not in my world! This thing is loud with a very high-pitched, screeching tone much like fingernails on a chalk board.    I'm returning this one. It's not worth the effort.|neg
I had seen these before in various hotels/motels. Last week I asked the maintenance person at the Place d'Armes about these units, and was told that they were very reliable, my favorite criteria.<br /><br />I ordered two on 2 day prime shipping and received them the very next day. They are unbelievably easy to install, and work flawlessly. No more dryers on the lavatory with the cords catching on the cabinet knobs.<br /><br />two thumbs up.|pos
The Hot Tools Prof. 800 Watt Ionic Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is too hot on high and too cool on low/cool.  It is uncomfortable to use it.  I am not sure what my next step is going to be, but I cannot recommend   this product.|neg
I am so glad Amazon had this product! It is a fabulous hair dryer. I have one upstairs and one in my downstairs bathroom.|pos
We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed.  The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly.  Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel.  I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It's better than dryers that are much more expensive.  Now we'll just have to see how long they last.|pos
I have very thick and corse - curly/wavy hair and I love this hair dryer!! It's nice and compact but has a lot of power. It dries my hair in half the time it used to with other bigger, more expensive dryers. I first used this in a hotel I stayed at and came on here the minute I got home to order it. For me, it's been so worth it! Love this!!|pos
I have had this product for a month and a half it it has worked wonderfully every morning. Not too loud, not scorching hot, dryes hair quickly, and I love the portability. I the retractor need a little help by pushing the cord in a bit at times and it easily snaps to fold. Fits great in my small drawer in the bathroom!|pos
The last blow dryer we bought cost almost $100.00  when it broke I headed my wife off and purchased this one from amazon and my wife said it was as good as the $100.00 one we had.|pos
I bought this dryer to replace my Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline, which I loved dearly.  I've tried a number of other Conair dryers, and none of them got quite hot enough, so I figured I'd give this one a try.    My hair: mid-back, quite thick, wavy/curly and frizz prone.  I usually dry it straight with a round brush instead of flat ironing, so I need a dryer that gets very hot.    Things I like about the dryer:    1. Great heat settings.  My old dryer went from hot to scalding.  This one blows truly cold air for the cool shot, cool air on low, warm on warm, and scalding on hot.  I was surprised by how well it dried my hair on warm (I usually use the highest setting the whole time), but I did need to use the hottest setting to get my hair straight.  This dryer gets hotter than anything I've tried in this price range, which for me is a huge plus.    2. Relatively quiet.  It sounds like a hair dryer, but is considerably quieter than any other product I've tried.      3. Good weight/feel.  Other reviewers have said it's heavy, but at least compared to the other Conair dryers I've used, I'd say it's about the same, maybe lighter.  Definitely not a problem unless you're used to a really, really lightweight dryer.  The surface is nice and grippy, and the balance feels good.    Overall, I'm very satisfied.  It dried my hair quickly, can attain the heat I need (but doesn't limit you to scaldingly hot), and didn't cost an arm and a leg.  Highly recommended!|pos
I bought one of these and it lasted 1 month. Great customer service sent me another and now three months later the same thing happened. The low speed switch burns out. Unfortunately this time Amazon bails out and makes you deal direct with the manufacturer for return.  I'm going to Conair.|neg
Amazon was very responsive, but the manufacturer did not mail out the product to my home in an appropriate amount of time. The distributor had to be prodded by Amazon to fulfill my request. The product is just perfect for my wife, but the delay was not pleasant.|pos
I never right reviews but had to say how much I LOOOOVE this blow dryer.  I have really thick hair and this blow dryer cuts my drying time in half.  I absolutely LOVE it and would recommend it to anyone.    [...]|pos
My wife loves this hairdryer. It has multiple speeds and settings and even the hot setting doesn't get too hot for her. It's lightweight and not too big. Still easy to travel with also.|pos
This blowdryer is excellent -- it can handle my lion's mane of hair. It is light to hold, easy to  hold and use and high-quality construction.  The Fekkai salon on 5th avenue NYC uses these dryers which is why I ordered it. I will note that the cord is surprisingly thick and heavy compared to other regular retail store blow dryers, but it provides a generous length.|pos
This hair dryer works great.  My hair is dry in no time at all.  Can't beat the price either.|pos
For $19.99 this is one of the best buys out there.  Wall mounted the cord and dryer are out of the way and off the counter.  Only 1600 watts but dries better then our bigger old one.  Small, compact and you can take it with you when traveling.|pos
Works great! Dries my hair with no problem and my hair isn't as frizzy as it usually is when I blow dry it. Haven't had any problems with it after the month I've had it. :)|pos
I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don't use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don't bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn't clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn't be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the ceramic or ionic thing.  Being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won't have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length.|pos
This is my second T3 dryer.  I have super duper thick hair and I can blow my hair in 1/2 of the time of any other hair dryer.  It's fabulous!|pos
Got this for my daughter for Christmas who lives in another state and she loves it...Thanks for all your good products.|pos
I argued with my lady about buying this hair dryer. I told her there were others, others less expensive, that would do the job. It is after all just  drying hair. After buying and trashing a Conair I finally bought her this Turbo Power dryer. THe complants stopped, the dryer still works and I am her hero. The rewards were worth the investment.|pos
After reading mixed reviews on this product I decided to take a chance since the price seemed good.  Upon reciept I plugged it in and the element overheated immediately.  The fan did not work and smoke started coming out of it.  Needless to say, after a long cool-down it went back in the box and was returned.  Amazon was great refunding my money as I certainly didn't want a replacement.  How it got a UL rating I'll never know.  I suggest spending a few more bucks and getting a quality item.|neg
I suggest you don't waste your cash on those expensive hair dryers when you can buy this one.  It comes in the ceramic/tourmaline design that is popular now, but more importantly, this dryer's wattage is much higher than most hair dryers out there (and I've looked!).  The higher the wattage, the more air it can move around...and that means faster dry times.  I've only used this a couple of times, so I don't know how long it will last.  So far, so good.|pos
This compact styler is fabulous. It folds up nicely so it takes up very little space. It has traveled throughout Europe and the Mediterranean with us and has never been a disappointment.|pos
I got the first one good so I order the second one.I'm happy with it.It's very organized.My kid love it too.|pos
This is great.  Used them in hotels in the past.  Convenient, always know where it is and it works great.|pos
I am seriously impressed. Next to laundry, blow drying my hair is my least favorite thing to do.  I was looking for something that would blow dry my hair fast.  I have very fine hair, longer than shoulder length. The first day I used this blow dryer I had it on medium heat and it took 10 minutes. That is how long my old blow dryer took, but my hair looked much healthier than with other blow dryers. The next day I used it, I set it to hot and it took only 5 minutes!  It still looked great, just as healthy!  My hair is always breaking and when I blow dry, normally the damage is very apparent.  With this blow dryer my hair looks smooth and shiny!  I love this blow dryer.  I highly recommended it!!|pos
I don't really like hair dryers because of the noise factor and the energy use, however sometimes I need one.  I used this one at my place of employment (I teach water classes) and found it does the job. It is small enough to travel easily.|pos
I already owned this blow dryer, but purchased a second one for travel. I really like this dryer for it's ease of use, temperature and air settings.  I like that the operating buttons are a slide up and down. This is a great feature since you don't accidentally turn the blow dryer off or change the settings while you are drying your hair, like other dryers with elevated buttons. I have a lot of hair and it's thick and this blow dryer, drys it very quickly. The heat is not overly hot, it's just right! The lower settings are perfect for styling. The dryer is also light weight. The price is lower than anywhere else and it arrived quickly and no shipping!|pos
I ordered and received my merchandise exactly as promised. No muse and no fuse. Just a perfect buying experience. I would recommend this vendor.|pos
This is an awesome dryer! My hair stylist recommended it as it is the same line used in her salon.  Very effective and cuts down the time required for drying in half.  Could never go back now that I know what a better dryer feels like.|pos
This dryer definitely lives up to its claims.  As an African American who has natural hair, I was looking for a product that would not dry-out my hair.  The technology of this dryer not only dries my hair quickly, but also leaves it hydrated with lots of moisture.  I use this for my daughter's hair as well, who has thick, coarse hair.  This dryer also provides moisture and helps with the manageability of her hair. I strongly recommend this product.|pos
This thing is way to small to be useful. If it were a portable, perhaps, but this is a wall mount! It's like a mini hand dryer. Returned it immediately after receiving it.|neg
This is a great little hair dryer. I wanted a hair dryer to use for both home & travel and the size is perfect.|pos
I used this type of dryer at my brother's house and recall it feeling powerful and pretty hot, even at a low setting - exactly what I was looking for in a new dryer.    Then i ordered one for myself and got a fairly crappy dryer that didn't get warm enough at a low speed setting and didn't feel powerful at all... My only impression is disappointment. I would not recommend this dryer for anyone looking for a quality dryer.|neg
After years of having a long magnificent mane...I decided that perhaps the bare minimum for the curls wasn't enough. I LOVE this hair dryer...I have nearly more long, curly hair than Shakira herself...and this dryer does the job very well on the low setting and quickly! I recommend the TRESemme Flawless Curls Defining Gel if you have thick curly hair and need a great dryer with a fantastic diffuser! The Salon quality at an affordable price with a SOLID DIFFUSER that wouldn't lose grip on the dryer is what I sought, and it's exactly what I got!|pos
This is a great hairdryer. I have a full sized one for home and it dries my hair in less than 2 minutes and I have long hair. It leaves hair smooth and silky and has not damaged it at all. I bought this one to put in my gym bag and I was worried that it wouldn't work as well as the full sized version. I highly recommend this hair dryer!|pos
This product should have come with a warning.  Even on the LOW setting, one can get a third degree burn from the heat.|neg
Love how lightweight & compact this blow dryer is!  Air concentration is great due to style/shape of the nozzle!  Easy to travel with & drys great!  It is more powerful & drys better than other higher watt blow dryers i've owned in the past.  Would highly recommend this product (& already have)!|pos
I had one of them for more than 14 years,but because it was quite old start acting funny. Still work, but sometimes didn't want to turn off. So, I bought an expensive one from a retail store and it was junk, I change that blow dryer twice in a year.  Then I decide to look here to see if I find my Turbo dryer and lucky enough I did.  I LOVE this blow dryer is the best. I have long hair and I like my hair super straight and the Turbo 1500 do the magic super easy.|pos
I don't personally use this unit, but my girlfriend does every morning, and it causes a huge degradation of my quality of life in the mornings.  It initially doesn't sound all that loud, but over time the high pitch squeal that it makes will start to drive you nuts.  I don't think she necessarily hears it as the sound exits through the back of the unit away from her, and I bear the brunt of the unpleasant noise.   Anyway I cannot recommend having one of these in your home if you live with other people.  I figured it's worth warning other people, so I made a quick stop to comment before shopping for a replacement so I can get back to relaxed mornings.|neg
I ordered this on Amazon from Elephant Deals. I received it quickly. The blower is fantastic. It has a steady, hot flow. It doesn't leave me with flyaways, and I don't have to use a flat iron when I'm done. It is quick and efficient. I highly recommend this blower.|pos
As I had minimal space on our bathroom  counter I needed a hair dryer that could hang out of the way.  I was able to attach it to the inside of the cabinet door below.  Thus it is out of sight when not in use and very available when needed.  As far as the function of the dryer, it lives up to my expectations.|pos
This replaced my old wall hairdryer. I Love the design and the night light is very nice to have. Very quiet when running and I have the option of changing from 1200W to 1600W. I would recommend this hairdryer.|pos
The Hot Tools Salon Dryer does not have enough power to actually dry your hair.  The dome doesn't fit around your head (or my head) like it does at the salon. The combination of the size of the device as well as the lack of heat that it blows out, make this a bad purchase. I do not recommend and I will be returning it.|neg
I have had my dryer for over a year now and have had no problems with it. It works as well now as it did when I received it. It is not too noisy and it is light weight enough for me (I hate a heavy dryer). It is a full size dryer , not a travel size, and it dries my hair quickly.  I like that it has 2 blow settings and 3 heat settings.  It is easy to change settings while drying.  I use it everyday....so it has had a real workout..|pos
I would NOT recommend this item, the wall mounting system is poor. The screws utilized to mount dryer to the wall bracket failed on the first turn. Additionally, the night light stopped working after 1 day.|neg
I went thru a couple dryers before finally finding this one.  I wanted quiet, cord reel, high power, and high heat.  What I did not want is hot pink (I hate pink.)  What swayed me was that it won an award from Allure magazine as being the best.  Thank you Allure.  Didn't realize how difficult it is to get a dryer that would meet all my requirements.  Totally excellent dryer.  Just wish they would make it in a neutral color like silver or black.|pos
I bought this hair dryer when I decided to replace my still working, but not doing the best job, Conair. I am a sucker for anything different, and this fit the bill. I washed my hair right after I bought it so I could check it out. After using it all I could think of were these three words: No Me Gusta. I didn't even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph. It takes me less time to dry my hair with my old conair and style separately then it would have taken me to style and dry with this thing.     I am returning it tomorrow and I'll buy a regular blow dryer.     Once again, NO ME GUSTA.|neg
My hair is so soft and it was so worth the money. I recommend it for anyone--also great gift idea    UPDATE I have had this item since 2011-And its still going strong!|pos
Nice quality, you get what you pay for. It's efficient and the temperature options as nice. I use the diffuser all the time for my curly hair to avoid frizzing and it locks on nicely. Also, the diffuser is nicely shaped so you can get it right on your scalp because it is curved, and it won't fall off all the time like it might with another brand. Make sure you don't click the blue button unless you want it locked on the cold temperature -- I almost thought I had a defective product because I didn't know I had clicked it by accident. Otherwise it's working great so far.|pos
So I hadn't updated my hair dryer in years (think 15), so I was really thrilled to receive this one. I would highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Doesn't die on me when I am using it (overheating). This is a big one for me. I have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much. Not this one!<br /><br />Nice, modern look. LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!<br /><br />Small, lightweight size.  MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy. Your hand won't fall off after using it! :)<br /><br />Usable Attachment.  I wasn't aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.<br /><br />Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it's not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn't burn your eyelashes off!  Perfect in either setting, even the cooler version actually still dries your hair well!<br /><br />Negatives: None that I can think of!<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend it! Great blow dryer!|pos
My 10 year-old Conair just died so I bought this model.  So far it has been perfect.  The airflow is great.  I love the temperature settings with the cool shot.  I mainly use the straightening attachment which is perfect.  This works just as well as the $150 ones at the salon.|pos
I have owned a T3 hairdryer for over 7 years now.  The first model I owned was the evolution model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  I still have it and it works.  I replaced it with the feather weight model only because I had back surgery and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes and I have A LOT of hair.  I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  I only take the attachment off when I want to simply blow the water out of my hair before styling it - then I put the attachment back on.    Don't hesitate - especially if you have unruly, curly, thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!|pos
If you travel and would like to style your hair at your destination then the Infinitipro by Conair 1875 is for you.  The foldable handle is perhaps the best invention since the invention of the blow dryer itself.  When folded it fits into its own carrier bag.  That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.  That's a lot of power to blow and to heat!  I would highly recommend this styler.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that the color looks great!|pos
This hair dryer shaved 1-1/2 hours off my hair straightening time.  I have curly (or better yet coily) hair and this hair dryer (with the comb attachment) goes through it like butter! I highly recommend this hair dryer!|pos
This is my second Andis hair dryer.  I had the first one over six years but it was starting to wear out.  I wanted to stay with this brand and this one is even better.  Lightweight and easy to hold.  I like the three heat settings which the older one did not have.  More important, styling is better and my hair really does feel silkier and looks shinier.  I recommend this product.|pos
This review is for the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer. The packaging of this product was nicely done and not too wasteful, but adequate enough to get the contents delivered without being broken or damaged. The product was easy to remove from the packaging, and the instructions for use were very straightforward and well written. The temperature controls and blower settings were intuitive, and the balance of heating and air movement seems to be very suitable. Overall, I was very pleased with the quality of this product.|pos
When turned on this blow dryer sounds different than any other I have previously owned. It sound stronger, with a quieter engine hum. The color is very cool and I like the turn and fold handle. The cord is durable and the settings are nice. The warm setting is just right and I like the cool down set style setting. It is full size, but not overly big and thus it is easy to handle and not tiresome to use. Highly recommend this blow dryer!|pos
Do  not buy this dryer it will stop working in 3 months i used this dry proberbly 3 times in 3 months and it just stop working and  you have to have the recipt to return it is just not worth it plus the heat come from one direction and you have to move you head so that ever were can dry skip it theirs a reason its priced so cheap|neg
I've used a blow dryer practically every day for the past 30 years so I consider myself a bit of an expert.  This is one of the best blow dryers I've used.  It's light but powerful and does a great job.  Highly recommended.|pos
I purchased this dryer about 6 months ago, and today when I was using it it started shooting out sparks. I looked it up on google and this has happened to a lot of people. It's even started shooting out flames and caused house fires when it's just PLUGGED IN and not even turned on. Just don't buy it, its dangerous.|neg
After having used a wall-mount Sunbeam hairdryer on vacation last summer, I really wanted one for my bathroom.  After researching many available on Amazon and other websites, I chose the Andis model because it offered the nighlight and a place for the cord. I've been using it now for two months.     Since it was going to take up a permanent spot in my outlet, it having a nightlight was dead useful.  I read other reviews saying that the nightlight was way too bright.  My husband and I disagree. We love the amount of light put out by the hairdryer.  It is signficantly brighter than our old nightlight which means you can get up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and never have to turn on the overhead light.  Isn't that the point of a nightlight?  Maybe the people who dislike the amount of light have it in a master bath and don't close the door to the bathroom and it bothers them when they sleep? My solution would be to shut the bathroom door in that case!    Sorry that this turned into a review of the nightlight feature!  The hairdryer gives you as 1400 or 1600 watt option and I use it on the 1600 because I have massively thick hair.  It dries my hair quickly and is not obnoxiously loud.  I like that it has a cord keeper and keeps everything tidy in my teeny bathroom.  My husband had the hairdryer mounted on the wall in less than 10 minutes and that includes my running up and down the stairs for the right screwdriver.    All in all, an excellent buy and I would purchase it again.|pos
My first Jerdon hair dryer lasted 10 years and we used it every day.  I bought another brand, and it lasted less than a year.  I just purchased another Jerdon Hair Dryer and I see why I bought it in the first place.  It is a terrific hair dryer!  I will buy no other.|pos
I first saw this product at my hairdresser's salon while she was blowing drying my daughter's hair.  This product was wonderful. It made her hair soft and light and dried her hair within minutes.  It also straightens the hair which my daughter loves as her hair is natural.  I also tried it on my relaxed hair and it did the same thing.  Awesome product.|pos
I bought this product based on customer reviews. It would impossible to overstate the poor quality of this product. Doesn't dry hair effectively. Hood is so  high  you need to sit on a stool. The mechanism for adjusting the height is extremely difficult to use...and still doesn't get it low enough to not have to sit on a stool or very high chair. There are no air drying vents on the sides of the hood. Top of the head gets all the heat.  Poor investment. We had to return.|neg
i ordered the T3Bespoke Labs hair dryer in 2010- within one year dryer stopped working- contacted discount jungle and was told to email dryer back for replacement- had to call several times and was told my dryer would be mailed out shortly or was on the way- one call was answered with it is no longer under warrenty - broken dryer mailed back to me with no explanation- i am not happy with this company and would not order from them again- i am now finding out they are an unauthorized dealer for the hairdryer|neg
Had for less than a month before it died.  Loved the size, retractable cord, folding ability.  It's a bit heavy for a travel dryer, but I didn't buy it for that....just it's compact size and retractable cord.  It just stopped working less than a month after receiving!!!!|neg
I got this to replace another Conair dryer that I LOVED.  I wish they would stick with their old way of doing things instead of improving.  It isn't as kind to my hair while drying and is too painful to my ears.  Am returning it.|neg
My wife with her beautiful long hair always uses a blow dryer after washing it. So this works perfect for the always have with you styler. It works great, looks great and the handle folds up nicely to make it compact. The lint catcher is detachable to easily clean off the lint and it also comes with a bag which helps keep the cord with the unit. Excellent styler and works great on my short hair, too!|pos
I've only had the product a short time and purchased it to install in my guest bathroom.  I had a guest visiting from England for three weeks and she loved it! She said it was better than most she has encountered in 1st class hotels.  I'm surprised how quiet it is.|pos
I bought the silver colored version of this at Target about 5 months ago.  I was happy with it until last week.  I straightened the collasable handle and heard a cracking sound.  The handle would no longer stay straight when I used the machine.  Like some of the other reviewers I found, upon opening up the device, that the very cheap plastic piece that kept the handle in the locked position had broken.  There was no way to fix it and it wasn't worth the hassle and expense to mail it in for repair.  So I bought a different brand last night.  I'm very unhappy with this product.|neg
I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it's frizzy & I need to flat iron it.  I was AMAZED by this hair dryer!  I used the comb attachment & after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  It was straight & shiny.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!|pos
I purchased two of these dryers, one for my daughter at college and one for at home.  Mine got everyday use, and it lasted almost 18 months.  I liked its small size, making it easy to store and nice to pack when traveling, but IT WAS VERY LOUD!  I'm sure that my hearing suffered from it's screaming airflow.  It was working fine until a couple of days ago when something blew to pieces inside and it shattered to a stop.  My daughter's is still working, but it only get used once and a while for travel.<br />I would NOT recommend this dryer.  My previous dryer, a Conair, lasted over 7 years with daily use.  (Sometimes even drying our long-haired dog.)<br />I purchased a new, full-sized Conair 121WFT Turbo in hot pink, yesterday.  It is so quiet and the grip is very comfortable.  I love it so far.<br />I would never go back to that ear shattering Remington again.|neg
This is a GREAT product. I have long, thick, curly, red hair, and it works wonders. Sometimes I want straight hair, so I'll brush and dry my hair at the same time for the straight hair, and it works great! This hair dryer dries my hair in 10 min flat, sometimes in 5 minutes depending on the day. I also love the cord that goes into the dryer itself. So awesome and convenient!! You must buy this hair dryer, it will change your life! :)|pos
I was skeptical about paying this much for a hair dryer...but a friend of mine highly recommended it..so I gave it a go.  From my frist drying experience I noticed a huge difference in my hair!  It is super quiet...did dry my hair faster, with less force and no tangling!  I love how light it is...and how shiney it made my hair!  I got a load of compliments that first day!  Worth the cash!|pos
The best blow dryer I've ever used. I may have to get another one. My wife and daughter are also using this. Very powerful but quiet motor. Many settings. Comes with a four year warranty. Highly recommended.|pos
This is an excellent dryer! It is dependable and delivers the temperatures I expect, but the main reason I chose this model is that the classic squirrel-cage blower produces great air flow. I was never satisfied with the wimpy blowers on most of the other styles.     I bought two of these from Amazon a few years ago. Two, because I thought such an inexpensive dryer might not last long very long and buying the pair was a better bargain because the order qualified for free shipping. The second one is still in the box awaiting its turn; the first one hasn't failed yet.    I see several comments here about travel. While this dryer is more compact than many of the bulky styling dryers, it is neither dual voltage (switchable) nor universal voltage (auto-converting), so pack a converter if you carry it overseas.  I use a smaller, folding, dual-voltage model for travel (then find that all the hotels have built-ins anyway).|pos
We purchased this item January 3, 2011 for my daughter's bathroom. We installed it the following week. She uses a hairdryer infrequently, about once or twice a week.  She informed us tonight that the nightlight stopped working last week and when she uses the hairdryer it smells like plastic melting. Sure enough, I just checked it out. No nightlight -- plastic burning smell when turned on. Our return period window for Amazon is now expired. I just wrote Andis an email explaining what happened and will be waiting for a response. I will update what (if anything) customer service does about this situation. Until then, I am giving this item one star.|neg
I love that Andis 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer!  It's powerful enough for my short hair, but not too powerful. It's compact so it'll be great for travel.|pos
Before my subjective impressions, let's note the specs first:<br /><br />- 1875W AC motor (powerful)<br />- 2 heat/speed settings<br />- cold air button (turns off the heat)<br />- easy to remove air filter<br />- safe ALCI plug - will turn itself off if blow drier is dropped in water<br />- one 'concentrator' accessory included<br />- zippered black nylon travel tote<br />- English/Spanish instructions sheet<br /><br />The makers claim that the motor has a 3x longer life when compared to DC Motor hairdryer models. They also state that the dryer is using 'ionic technology' which 'promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz'.<br /><br />One distinct feature is the 'folding handle'. You can twist it (careful or you can break it) in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling. It's also easier to store it in a drawer when not traveling.<br /><br />The 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics. First, it's 4 YEARS which is not bad. Second, even if you can't produce a receipt, they promise to honor the warranty based on the unit's manufacture date. You are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include $7 to have the unit shipped back. And, of course, they will not cover any damage that you may inflict.<br /><br />There are no 'negatives' I detected. The INFINITY iPRO gets you all the power you need, the noise level is on par to similar devices and the 4 year warranty indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device and it appears to be so. The travel-ready folding handle and the included tote bag are pluses which earn the iPRO its 5 stars.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;|pos
The Infinitipro by Conair is a hair dryer that features an ingenuous design which makes it ideal for home or travel. Just twist the handle to fold down, retract the cord and then pack the unit into the included zip pouch. What a great concept!<br /><br />Without sacrificing any of the features you might expect from a great hair dryer, the compact design makes this product stand out from the competition. Highly recommended!|pos
I don't understand why the packaging says AC motor and the blurb says DC - however it works great.  It does have a large-ish plug which I assume is a transformer from AC to DC.  I love the color which is more intense than in the picture - think Granny Smith Apple. I thought it would be smaller than it is since it is sort of billed as a travel dryer.  The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  I don't mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and most travel dryers are pretty feeble. What more can I ask?  It says it will last longer than most dryers which is great. It only has a few settings - Hi and low plus a cool shot override button - all I ever use anyway.|pos
I've always thought that the wall-mounted hair dryers in hotel rooms were a great idea.  They don't take up space on your bathroom counter, you don't have to wrap the cord around and around your hair dryer (which can eventually lead to internal wire damage), and you don't have to find a separate place to store it.  I never thought of actually owning one in my own home until I visited my sister a few years ago, and she had this one mounted on her guest bathroom wall.  It worked great, and I knew right then that I needed one of these.  I wrote down the model number and went online to buy one as soon as I returned home.  My husband was more than happy to install this (a couple of screws) since it meant no more hair dryers laying on the bathroom sink.  We both liked it so much that he even suggested that I go ahead and buy another one and have it on hand for when the first one wore out.  My granddaughter told me the other day that she needs one of these.  Guess I know what she's getting for Christmas this year.|pos
i love being able to just sit under the dryer and read while i deep condition my hair. not too hot, and it covers my entire head. fast shipping and good pricing for hot tools!!|pos
This product comes with a one year warranty from the merchant as opposed to a four year warranty from the manufacturer. There is no serial number attached to the power cord so you can't register for warranty.  Also our product made a distinctive sound that we did not have when we bought our first hair dryer from the manufacturer directly 5 years ago... Lesson learned, wanted to try to save on the purchase price, lost on the quality and warranty. Attempting to return the product. I would advise not to buy this product from this merchant.|neg
This hair dryer was recommended by my hair stylist. It would cost $200 at a retail store. She suggested I check on Amazon for a better price. I got the hair dryer for half the retail price. The ionic ceramic tourmaline dryer is less damaging to hair. The best thing is that it's quiet for a blow dryer ... more of a hum than a high pitch whistle of some blow dryers.|pos
I am always looking for organizational tips.  When I saw this hair dryer I thought this would be perfect to cover the hole that a non operating  wall phone would leave. It is perfect and no storage problem.  Works well.[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]|pos
I bought this Jerdon Wall Mount Hair Dryer to save space and for company convenience. It was mounted in an upstairs bathroom and lightly used. The Jerdon hair dryer was purchased in August 2010 and quit working in March 2011. It's not a good idea to purchase electrical items on Amazon......After 60 days NO RETURN! If I had paid a little more and bought locally, I would have gotten my money back or another item. Sometimes when you think you are saving money, you're not. I lost all the way around. I will not purchase electrical items from Amazon in the future. Bad idea!|neg
I use it a lot, i am a stylist and use this with my really curly hair clients and it never disapoint me. great price, great quality, great buy.|pos
I have been using this product for nearly a month now. From a guy perspective I think this product is really great. I use this product since my hair is quite long and for some personal reason I don't like to dry my hair using my towel. Anyway, the best thing about this hair dryer is that it dries my hair really fast and also produce low noise. Well, if you use the high air mode, the noise is quite loud but much tolerable than other products I have used. Basically I just used the low air mode since the noise is low and it isn't too hot.     Furthermore, when you first use this product, it will have a burning metal smell (like soldering smell). However, after 3-4 times of use the smell will be gone. The smell won't stick on your hair though, so it isn't a big deal. This hair dryer is light which I think is a plus.|pos
I bought this hair dryer to replace another Conair I had for many years.  After one year I am going back to my old one.  There is NO WAY to clean the vents on this one and it heats up HOT.  It burned the top of my ear the other day.  The retractable cord is a nice idea, but if it retracts too fast you end up with bruises from it hitting you in the arm.  Look for the Conair dryers that have vents that can be cleaned and they will last you a good long time.  Then only good thing about it is it travels well.|neg
I purchased the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 six months ago, and it was love at first blowdry. During high school and college, I owned a series of inexpensive, low quality hair dryers. Yes, after half an hour or more and some expletives, they did dry my hair, but it was always flat and without shine. I blamed my hair, rather than the hair dryers.<br /><br />At the warm heat setting and high fan setting, this FHI hair dryer gives me soft, voluminous waves in less than fifteen minutes. I never knew my hair could look so beautiful and healthy! I blow dry it immediately after every morning shower, and I use [[ASIN:B004461ZL4 Sedu Anti-Frizz Polishing Treatment with Argan Oil, 6.8 oz. bottle]].<br /><br />Oh, and I almost forgot! The first time I turned it on, I thought I had received a defective model like some of the other reviewers. But I had accidentally pressed the blue cold shot button found on the inside of the hair dryer handle.<br /><br />UPDATE (after one year): I still love this hair dryer, and it's working just as well as the day I purchased it.|pos
Bought this model a few years ago and I really like it because the high setting speed is just right for styling your hair...some other dryers I have blow too fast on the high setting.  This model's high setting is a good speed and allows you to dry your hair without it blowing all over the place.  Also it is light and well balanced so holding it while drying is very comfortable.  I recently bought 2 more in case the manufacturer decides to stop production.|pos
i have limited space in my apartment..every inch counts. that doesn't mean that i don't want the best, and i have it in this teeny tiny dryer. tucks into one of my baskets when not in use, but when in use, works like a charm.|pos
My hair type is naturally wavy, thick, and frizz-prone.  With this hairdryer, my hair is not frizzy!  YAY!  It's super powerful, and dries my hair quicker than my old hairdryer.  This hairdryer is so great, it makes the need for my straightener optional.  I have the Argan Heat straightener, and love it, too.  They are the perfect pair to get silky, shiny hair.  I also like that my hair feels soft with this.|pos
I loved my first Oster wall mount hair dryer; it lasted 8 years before I had to replace it with the same model. No. 2 just died after 7 years' dependable service (the plastic fins on the fan became brittle and snapped off.) There's no use trying to improve on such a reliable product, so I'm ordering No. 3. The current price is only slightly higher than what I paid for the other two.|pos
I love this hairdryer, but for some people, they may not be completely ecstatic with the settings of this hairdryer.  WIth this hairdryer, you cannot really control the temperature of the air, only how intense the air flows from the dryer.  The only way to change the temperature of the air is to press the blue button on the hair dryer to make the air cooler.  Other than that side note, I love the color of the hairdryer and how quickly it dries my hair (my hair is long and it takes about 15 minutes to blow dry my hair).|pos
Was very pleased with this purchase.  The profile is slim and looks well to hang on wall.  It has different speeds with pleases me.  Very happy to have purchased this as a replacement  for one I had for years.  Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer|pos
The hair dryer is very easy to install.  You first mount a flat metal plate to the wall and then the base unit attaches to that plate.  We bought these for a vacation rental and appreciate the fact that the power cord is attached to the base unit and not the hair dryer itself.  While this may not be convenient or preferred for home use, in a vacation rental it keeps them in one place.|pos
Yes, it's almost a full size hair dryer BUT it does fold and the cord retracts.  More importantly it's Powerful ... More than other so called travel hair dryers with the same wattage 1875!  AND the cold shot doesn't slow down to the point of almost being off, like other travel hair dryers!!! Annoying.  But not on this one.  Of course I'd prefer a lighter dryer with the same features but until then this one fits the bill.  I'd rather lug something a little heavy that's going to get me out the door FAST and enjoying my vacation!  At this price, I'll be perfectly happy if it only lasts me thru my upcoming 10 day vacation.  Good price.|pos
Powerful hairdryer.  It doesn't have a cool setting, so if that is a concern check out the other Andis dryers.  LOVE the bright night light, it is a soft white!|pos
The concept seemed perfect - combing and drying your hair at the same time.  The problem is that it simply does not dry my hair.  Not even at the highest setting.  Very disappointing.|neg
I bought this dryer to replace a virtually identical but much older Vidal Sassoon hair dryer (the VS781),which had finally stopped working after probably a decade.  The thing I liked most about the older dryer, and which I like about this one (which is basically the same dryer with a new color and model number), is that it doesn't get excessively hot even on the highest setting, and doesn't blow as hard as most other dryers.      For someone with thick hair this might be a real problem, but I've got very thin, fine, slightly frizzy hair that doesn't benefit from a strong airflow.  Most hair dryers, even on lower speeds, dry sections of my hair so rapidly that I don't have a proper chance to style them with a brush, and the rest of my rather sparse hair gets whipped around as if in a tornado.  That doesn't happen with this Vidal Sassoon model.  The oval-shaped barrel seems to also help concentrate the airflow.      I also like the fact that this dryer has three heat settings and two speed settings which can be selected independently.  With some dryers high speed is paired with high heat whether you want it or not.      The ionic setting on this dryer DOES make a difference and makes my hair a tad smoother - however it also tends to make it more limp.  So as a rule, I use the dryer with the ion setting in the off position except when drying the ends of my shoulder-length hair.  Probably someone with thick, coarse hair wouldn't have this issue.         I've had this dryer for only about 5 weeks, so it's too early to comment on whether it's built to last - I was definitely lucky to get so many years out of my older model.  This model might not be just right for every head of hair, but for mine, it's perfect.  I hope Vidal Sassoon continues making this type of dryer for a long time.|pos
I gave this dryer to my sister, who raved about it and said it was the best hair dryer she'd ever used. Here is the review she wrote for me:    The Remington Pearl Ceramic hair dryer comes with a full line of useful features...    Among its better aspects, the dryer is attractive, lightweight, and marvellously quiet. It has a cool shot as well as three heat settings which get warm enough to dry hair quickly, without frying it.    The dryer comes with an attached hook from which it can be hung, as well as a diffuser and a concentrator. The result is sleek, straight, or wavy hair -- depending on which attachment you use. I highly recommend this dryer. I can find nothing negative to say about it.    So... there ya go!|pos
I had first seen/used this hairdryer at a Hampton Inn and was impressed with how well it performed: quiet, powerful, and solid.  Not too heavy, with a grippy handle.  So...I bought one for myself and love it!|pos
I received the hair dryer Nov 15 and by the end of January high had totally quit working.  By the time I was able to get on line the end of February (because of personal issues) to find out how to return it, it was too late to get free shipping and a full refund, so guess I'm stuck with it.|neg
Absolutely LOVE this dryer! I have really thick/coarse hair and have always had to flat iron my hair after drying; but not anymore!!! 15 minutes and I am ready to go!!! No flat iron necessary!!!|pos
Conair is a great brand for hair dryers. My previous one was still going after 8 years but figured it was just time for an upgrade! This hair dryer is GREAT: heats up quickly, dries hair fast and really does have a comfortable grip. The cool air button gets cold fast too, and it's not very loud, even on high. Great quality product for the price!|pos
I purchased this product and within one week there was no warm/hot air at all.  Only cold air.  Save your money.|neg
I purchased this dryer on sale at CVS. I love the cord keeper. I just hold onto the cord while it's retracting. The removable filter is much better than other dryers I've used, because there is a plastic piece that keeps lint from actually getting into the dryer. This dryer is much more powerful and lighter then any other dryer I've ever used. I have very thick coarse hair. With other dryers it took me 45 minutes to over and hour to blow dry my hair. This one dries my hair in 15 - 30 minutes. It leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers. I still have to use a flatiron, but it only takes one pressing on each section instead of several to get it to lay flat.    I strongly recommend this product.|pos
Ordered 2 of the 3500, but received the 3200, which was a lower model, lower priced, by mistake. Somehow, I don't believe that. I feel as if they were trying to see if I would notice the difference. Then when I asked for an exchange, they said they didn't have any more of the 3500s. Sounds fishy to me!|neg
I tested this hair dryer at a Ritz Carlton and loved it - didn't even unpack my own.  I ordered one upon my return and have been using it daily for over a month.  My short, permed hair stays shiny and does not dry out.  This dryer is fantastic!  The retracting cord works smoothly, too.|pos
I have had three T3 hair dryers. I really liked the lightweight aspect but the heat control stopped working on all of them including the travel version. It is impossible to use any of them because the the high heat gets so hot now that it burns my hair. If I put it on a lower setting  the air is just less forceful. The worst part is that I contacted the company and they didn't even respond. I will never buy anything from this company again.|neg
This is a replacement wall mounted hair dryer.  I had one exactly like it that I mounted in my bathroom 13 years ago when we moved into our new home.  It is extremely handy and up out of the way.  I never have to deal with tangly cords or plugging it in.  It's powerful and efficient.  If it weren't awesome, I wouldn't have bought my second one.  You won't be disappointed.|pos
The fit and finish of this product is excellent, it has a high quality blower fan and the exterior material as commented by a previous reviewer is designed to avoid scratching on the counter.<br /><br />My girlfriend loves this dryer because it is powerful and she has a lot of hair which is difficult to completely dry and straighten, although she did mention that on the lower heat setting it avoids overheating.<br /><br />This dryer has a 4 year warranty so what else can you say, it is a high quality dryer.|pos
Ok Here goes. I will explain why this hair dryer is amazing not the circumstances. My two daughters with hair down to their but dry their hair in my wife & I's master bedroom bath. They get up in the morning about 1.5 hours before we do, to go to school. For years the last hour of our sleep was inturupted and we might as well have gotten up with them. This dryer makes 70% less noise & drys their hair in way way less than half the time. The air velocity & heat is not matched by anything out there. Trust me I have bought them all, looking for some peace & quiet in the morning. The velocity alone is triple that of any I have ever seen and the fact that at this air output you can still melt plastic (within 1 inch). They drop this thing every day, yes I hear it even over the use noise and it take a beating. I love this hair dryer even though I used it only 1 time (it dried my short/medium length hair in less than 1.5 minutes. With the other dryers, twenty plus minutes each to dry my girls hair now twenty minutes maybe total. I love this dryer and I only used it once.|pos
I rarely ever write customer reviews, but this one seemed to warrant it. Here goes:    If you want a hair dryer that BURNS OFF YOUR HAIR AND CAN POTENTIALLY MAKE YOU BALD, this hair dryer is for you! For a waste of $18-$21 American, YOU TOO CAN BE A 21 YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH SYMPTOMS OF FEMALE PATTERN BALDNESS!!!! WOW!    This little hottie also turns healthy, beautiful hair into crispy, damaged sh&*--EVEN WHEN YOU HOLD THE DAMNED THING 6 INCHES AWAY FROM YOUR HEAD!    But wait, there's more!    Wait just a few years until this baby shoots out sparks from both ends of the body AT 6 A.M. one fine Monday morning (like it did for me this morning), and RISK BOTH BURNING OFF MASSIVE CHUNKS OF YOUR HAIR *AND* SEVERELY BURNING YOUR RIGHT HAND/CAUSING A FACIAL DEFORMITY VIA AN ELECTICAL SPARK! YES!    The lesson of the day is: DO NOT BUY THIS HAIR DRYER/PIECE OF SH&^ OR ANY HELEN OF TROY PRODUCT IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO KEEP A NORMAL-LOOKING HAIR/VISAGE/SELF. THEIR PRODUCTS ARE D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S C-R-A-P.|neg
I have fine dry frizzy hair, not straight not wavy. I used cheap dryers before and was very skeptical that any expensive dryer can make any difference. But I was wrong, this dryer DOES make a difference. With FHI Heat Nano it takes me just under 5 minutes to dry my hair and as result my hair looks great: it gives volume (with no gels or mousses), remove frizz and make it straight (with no iron).   Highly recommend this product.|pos
This dryer is deafeningly loud, heavy and unwieldy, and none of the attachments fit. It's a terrible piece of machinery. Don't waste your money.|neg
Serves the purpose excdellent. Easy hand held position compared to other dryer are awkward to hold. I definitely would recommend this dryer and seller to a friend.|pos
i am glad that i bought this product.its powerful and if you want you can reduce the power as you wish.its the perfect thing i was looking for.|pos
I decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon since the 5-star ratings far exceeded the negatives.  Got it about 15 months ago, and totally loved it. It was light and quiet and fast. I have medium length, super thick, baby fine, curly hair.  About a month ago, it started getting louder. Then it just stopped. I opened it up and one of the blades had broken inside.  I have never dropped this, and it ALWAYS goes back in the drawer...I even wrap and secure the cord every time. I took out the partially broken piece, and used it for a couple more weeks. However, its even louder now, like a jet engine and vibrates ferociously. Never again! I thought I was buying a great hair dryer that would last me for years. HAHA!|neg
I need to replace this dryer. I have somewhat fine hair, and this dryer is frying it on the ends. I'm going to purchase a Revlon tourmaline dryer again. I had one previously, which worked great, but died after a few years of use. Guess I was caught up in how cute this one is. If you have fine hair, stay away.|neg
I decided to buy this hair dryer after sifting through consumer reports and customer reviews. I couldn't be happier to have the quality of this dryer at the price I paid. I have VERY thick, longer hair that used to take me 10-15 minutes to get completely dry in the past. I have never used this new dryer for longer than 5 minutes because it dries so quickly without leaving that singed, damaged feel I used to get with my old dryer. The ceramic/ionic features must be doing their jobs because it really lives up to the description. Love the retractable cord. I'm very impressed!|pos
I've had this hairdryer now for about 3 - 4 weeks.  Just love the low heat setting - temperature remains comfortably low even when increasing the speed to high.  It is fairly light and quieter than others I've had.|pos
I know it's an obnoxious color but the bottom line is, it works amazingly well. It's powerful but not super loud (for a hair dryer, at least), I can get my long hair dry and straight in about 8-10 minutes on warm temperature + medium strength (I'd rather take a couple extra minutes than do extra damage to my hair), and the settings are user-friendly. Before I bought it, I didn't care so much about the retractable cord but now that I've had it for a while, I don't think I could ever go back! It's an incredibly convenient feature, especially living in a tiny NYC apartment. I highly recommend this product.|pos
I recieved this hair dryer last night and this morning it does not work.  The heating element came on,  but no air.|neg
A bit heavier than most and cost a little more but but it is a whole bunch better than the cheaper ones.  Definitely a good product|pos
THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME. I DID NOT REALIZE HOW BAD MY OLD DRYER WAS UNTIL I STARTED USING THIS ONE. I CAN DRY MY VERY THICK, CURLY HAIR IN NO TIME AND CONTROL ANY FRIZZ.|pos
I had this hair dryer for only 3 months before my hair started smoking and I got burns on my hands from the dryer. I will be emailing Revlon immediately. DO NOT BUY-DANGEROUS!!!!!|neg
I love this blowdryer. I have a lot of thick hair and this blowdryer cuts my drying time in half! It's great! It's quieter than other blowdryers. I have used the diffuser, and like it; but I haven't yet used the other (don't know what's it's called).|pos
I am really enjoying the hair dryer and enjoy the wall mount so it hangs out of the way nicely.|pos
First used this product at a hotel in Vegas.  Bought one for home and love it.  Leaves hair smooth and retractable cord makes for easy storage.|pos
Dryer is lightweight and delivers a lot of heat.  Dries and smoothes hair quickly. Cuts down drying time down in half.  Wont go back to standard dryers.|pos
I used this hair dryer while staying at a Marriott hotel and loved it.  My hair dries in a much shorter amout of time and comes out soft without the frizz.  The folding handle and retractable cord make it easy to transport and store.  I ordered an ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser which was three times more expensive, didn't work nearly as well, and broke within a year.  My daughter-in-law used it recently and couldn't believe how quickly her hair dried......|pos
This hair dryer is the most powerful I've ever used. It actually kicks when you start it, that's how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer's unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I've tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There's a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer's strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist. There's a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well-made dryer. The Remington Ac2015 is an excellent professional grade dryer that is easy to recommend.|pos
This hair dryer works fast to dry hair. It's quiet in operation even on high speed.<br /><br />The body of the dryer is smooth feeling, kind of soft almost. Not like a hard shiny plastic feels. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />There is a removable intake filter allowing a clean fan.<br /><br />The cord is long enough to use the dryer comfortably.<br /><br />There is plenty of power and heat to dry even the longest hair quickly. The added pearl ceramics is supposed to help with prevent hair damage. We'll see.<br /><br />You could pay more for a hair dryer, but why?|pos
I love this blow-dryer!  What a great purchase...you won't be disappointed.  It makes my hair shiny and smooth after using this blow-dryer and dries fast too.  I highly recommend!|pos
loved it|pos
I had the same problem as other reviews. After the first use, the dryer stopped blowing hot air. Such a disappointment. Especially since the one time I used it, it did an amazing job.|neg
I finally realized just how much my tiny travel hairdryer was damaging my hair so I started searching for a new one. I picked this one, and I am very happy with it so far. I use a small amount of leave-in conditioner and a few drops of a defrizz product and my hair turns out great! The dryer has a nice array of settings; I usually put it on the hottest setting because the others don't seem warm enough. The cool setting works well, too. The dryer is fairly quiet, too, even at high settings, which is a huge change from my travel dryer. The one drawback I've found so far is the weight of this dryer. My travel dryer was of course very light and compact so it's been an adjustment getting used to the size and weight of this one. My arm gets a little tired as I'm finishing, but it's not a big problem. Definitely a good purchase!|pos
Very happy with my new hair dryer- great for easy drying natural curls.  the dryer arrived quickly and in perfect condition.|pos
While my wife was using the Elchim Professional Type 2001 1500/1800W hair dryer to dry her hair, FLAMES - yes that's right flames, not sparks - shot out of the base of the handle at the point where the power cord enters.    This was totally unexpected since the wire and handle showed no visible signs of damage.  Thankfully, my wife was not injured.  However, please be aware that this may occur with this dryer and could cause serious injury to someone.  My wife has had the dryer for 3 or 4 years and has not abused it.    I emailed Elchim to advise them of the problem and asked if they would like to test the dryer to see what may have caused it.  I told them I would be happy to send it to them if they sent me a prepaid shipping label.  After receiving no response, I sent a follow up email.  Still no response.    My only intention is to alert buyers/users of this potential danger so that no one gets hurt.|neg
I have had only two blow dryers in my life, so I'm not an expert on this. I just know it works, it's hot enough for me. There are three settings for the heat: low, medium, and high. I also like the flat head it comes with.    I hope it could have come with a fold-able option 'cause this blow dryer does take up some space. It's a pretty awkward shape to be stored in my cabinet. The cord also isn't retractable, like my old one, which lasted for over ten years. The cord is short, but if you're just using it inside the restroom and not walking around the house with it, it should be fine.     I don't understand what's the function of that extra button with the snow design on it?|pos
I just got this hair dryer a few days ago to replace one that randomly stopped working. I love this product so far- it is very sturdy without being too heavy. The cord reel is a great feature and makes storage very easy.     The hair dryer itself works great. Compared to my last one, this dries so fast! The temperature settings are also very nice with the hot not being *too* hot, and the cool is actually cool. I hope this dryer performs as well in the future as it has so far!|pos
This is by far the best blowdryer I have ever used. I've been using Conair's Yellowbird for 33 years, since I was 13. After using the Blackbird, I am equally impressed (if not more). My 25 year old daughter is now a big fan as well. I highly recommend these blowdryers...as I said, by far the best!|pos
I bought this as a replacement for my daughter's old compact hairdryer.  I haven't used it myself; but based on what she said--it is small, light, cute, not obnoxiously loud, doesn't get too hot, and doesn't suck her hair into the intake (like her old one did.) The first day she used it, she came downstairs and said, Either I'm having a fabulously lucky hair day, or this hairdryer is as awesome as it's supposed to be!  We are pleased with the purchase and would buy this item again.|pos
My 12 yr old daughter has long, very thick hair and her arms get tired when she blow dries it. This allows her to read, enjoy a snack and blow dry her hair all at once.  It isn't as fast as a hand held dryer but if she's reading, the longer the better. It has air holes all over the inside and works great for her thick hair.  The ends of her hair that stick out of the bottom take a little longer but it's worth it.  I'm thinking of trying it out... It was a little difficult trying to find a place to set it and a chair that was just the right height. She just keeps it set up all the time and it's become a permanent fixture in her room. Definitely worth it.|pos
I bought this hairdryer under the impression that I was getting some magnificent piece of equipment. At $200, this magnificent piece of equipment starting whistling at me within DAYS of using it. I went back to the store, and they kindly exchanged it. About one week later, it began whistling again. I went back to the store and they exchanged it for me. The third hairdryer I received didn't whistle until about a month of using it. Because this hairdryer got so many great reviews, I was willing to exchange it one more time, and so, I got my fourth hairdryer in 2008. It worked great up until about four days ago when I smelled something that smelled like it was burning. That alarmed me, but I ignored it. Then two days later, I heard something pop inside my hairdryer. After that, there was a piece of something rattling around inside of it! I finally had had enough, so today, I returned my hairdryer and got my money back. My husband did some research, and we found a great $35 hairdryer that works just as well, if not better, than the $200 piece of crap that I had to return multiple times.|neg
My old dryer broke and I was not sure what kind of product I wanted to get. It turned out the Sedu Revolution Pro is the answer.  It feels like a real professional dryer! Would recommend to anyone!|pos
I bought this hairdryer to replace my $200 hairdryer that crapped out on me FOUR times. I have only used it twice, but I am very happy with it. I don't notice ANY difference between the performance of the two.|pos
My mother gave me this dryer around 15 years ago, and still working   I'm buying the same one since the electric cord is acting up.   No questions about it is the best one!!|pos
Read the other reviews...I wish I had spent more time reading them!  This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost.  While it worked, it was very nice.... though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase.  But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord.  Too bad the quality is so poor.  STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER.  There are too many reviews like this one.|neg
This dryer offers all the options you need and delivers the good solid service in an almost professional manner.  I find it easy to use and very effective and easy to move around.  Three speeds and heat levels give you every option plus it has an ionic mode as well.  For the money a very good purchase.|pos
I have used the Elchim Professional 2001 for several years.  My son's girlfriend needed a hair dryer and tried mine.  She was amazed as to how quickly the Elcim dried her long thick hair.  She had to have this hair dryer for Christmas and is loving the ease of use.|pos
So far, I have been pleased with the purchase.  If that changes, I will come back and adjust my review.|pos
I am a hair stylist at a busy salon and I don't know what I would do without my t3 bespoke dryer. It blows very hot but not too hard so it dries the hair without making it frizz. The only negative is that they're not made of the best quality parts. I had my last one for 2 years which is the length of the warranty before it broke which for me is a good run. For an at home use would last longer.|pos
This dryer is heavy and loud, I would not recommend it to anybody.  I was in a hurry for a new dryer so I bought it at retail store for 59.00.  Sooooo not worth it.  AND, the air is not hot at all.  It blows cool air on the hot setting. Also, the buttons on the side turn the dryer off while drying.  They were put in an awkward spot.  HATE IT!  And no, I'm not the one to sit and write reviews unless I feel very strongly about something. And this, I feel that everyone should know so they don't waste their money like I did.|neg
I was in desperate need of a new hair dryer. I read several different reviews on Amazon.com and decided to go with the Remington D-2012. I am very happy with my decision! I have been using the hair dyer now for a few weeks now and have definitely noticed a difference in my hair. The dryer leaves my hair feeling really soft and super shiny.  It would be great if it was a little lighter (weight-wise) but I would not say it is heavy at all.|pos
I loved this dryer for its small, compact size and remarkably fast drying speeding.. so much so that I bought one after the other, after the other, when my first one burned out. I suspected it was because of the dual-voltage aspect, taking its toll on the little guy while I was in the UK and Europe. However, I started noticing a pattern when I bought MY THIRD Andis 33805 dryer in the USA. With fairly normal use (once a day at the most) and careful care, this dryer still didn't last A FEW MONTHS before it started getting too warm, lost its turbo power, sparked and ultimately fried. I guess you get what you pay for and I'm not ready to shell out for Andis turbo #4, despite my previous love affair.|neg
This is just what a hair dryer should be. Out of the way when not in use, easy and powerful. I just bought three more, one for work (I am a barber) one for my other bathroom and a spare.|pos
It's too heavy, it wiggles when you dry because of the folding handle, the retractable cord is too short, it's noisy, the buttons are insanely hard to turn on, the cool shot button is too easily pushed by mistake and it's toooooooo heavy!  When you have long hair you feel like you have been lifting weights with one arm for 20 minutes. Ouchie...... DO NOT BUY IT!  The people are Revlon need to go back to the drawing board with this one.|neg
awesome hair dryer,this is not a cheap one from your local variety store,well built works great worth every pennie and then some,GREAT BUY.|pos
I got this blower dryer for Christmas after I had picked it out and had it on my wish list.  I decided to make sure it worked before I threw away all the packaging.  As soon as I turned it on there was a funny burning smell.  I ran it for about 30 seconds on high and turned it off and smoke came out of the barrel.  I waited about five minutes and tried it again, same thing happened.|neg
En realidad todo llego bien y es un muy buen equipo lo recomiendo fue una entrega rápida recomiendo al vendedor|pos
Very disappointed with this product. It is so heavy when I suction cupped it to my mirror, I thought my door to my medicine cabinet (where my mirror is located) was going to break off its hinges. Then, it falls off when I try to put my hair dryer in it. My dryer fell in the sink and broke. It also does not fit my Vidal Sassoon flat hair dryer. The arm is very rigid and does not allow for repositioning the dryer. Last, it is very hard to store as it is so big and bulky. Not using it anymore. TOO INCONVENIENT!|neg
I rarely leave reviews, but I have used my new hairdryer 4 times now and I am amazed.  The power, the smooth sounds, the quality and results are amazing.  My hair came out so smooth I thought that perhaps I put too much product in my hair, and I almost thought that the product made my hair a tad oily.  Nope that's just the natural shine.  Wow.  My husband did a great job when he overheard me shopping at Bed and Beyond one day and I was admiring the expensive hair dryers.  He paid attention and researched and voila -- a wonderful and very thoughtful Christmas present!  Less time, less frustration and feeling a little bit prettier in the mornings is well worth the money.  Thank you FHI!|pos
This is a nice hair dryer, like that is has three blower settings. Works well on my think long hair, easy grip handle.|pos
Bought this item and didnt use it for another two or three weeks after purchase, but when i did!!! OMG I totally love it! Nice price and its a nice soft pink, looks great and feels great, that I want to wash and dry my hair everyday!! Its quiet, easy to handle and work with! Totally love it!!|pos
This is a great hair dryer! Unlike some of the reviews I do not feel it is heavy ,but I have always used a full sized dryer as opposed to some of the more compact ones out there in the market. I did have to get used to the switch placement the first couple of times I used it, and the nozzles can be difficult to turn if they are put  on too tight, but these are minor adjustments one has to make while getting used to a new product.     My hair is noticeably straighter and very soft since starting to use this dryer, I don't necessarily feel it dries my hair any quicker than my old one  did, but the end results are definitely  better!|pos
love this product!|pos
I bought this because of the great reviews.  I color my hair (to cover gray) and blow drying always takes too long and hair looks dry and have some sticking up all over.  I bought this and OMG!!!  It took half the time to dry and no fly-away hair!!  I have gotten so many compliments.  I loved it but never thought anyone would notice.  I really do get such nice compliments.  Remember I am over the hill and hair seems to get dryer with the years and coloring doesn't help that except cover the gray which I am so happy for that.  But if you feel your hair is getting too dry and/or frizzy, fly-away hair --- this will take care of it. Its a one-time purchase and so worth it.  3-temperatures and a cool button which I love.  What can I say, oh it is not all that heavy, regular weight as other unless you want a little blow and a lot of noise from a much cheaper hair blower.  Been there done that... this is the BOMB!!!  Don't waste more time or money on frustrating hair blowers, be good to yourself and buy this awesome hair blower.      Take care and you will not regret it for one second.|pos
Plain and simple - this is a great hair dryer.  I have my cosmetology license and have bought very expensive dryers in the past, with the same results as I've gotten with (this) Andis' moderately priced version.  I will seek out this brand without hesitation in the future.|pos
I found it very hard to buy a blow dryer on line but after some research and talking with my hair stylist I decided to purchase the FHI Nano.  I couldn't be happier with this product.  The best feature is the three heat options.  This dryer really does leave your hair looking silky and healthy.  You definately will see a big difference compared to the cheaper dryers.  If you need to replace your dryer this is worth the money.|pos
We were a little skeptical but this hair dryer does what it claims. First, it's a lot quieter than any other hair dryer we've used. They're all a little noisy but this one is by far the least noisy. It claims to make your hair shinier, too. Maybe, if you use it the right way. We've been using this for over a month now and it's hard to tell but we're inclined to believe the hype. Overall, a superb product so far.|pos
I had the perfect blowdryer... that was until I moved. Nonetheless, I was pretty worried about getting a new one. I have been through a fair share of terrible no good hair dryers. Looove this one! It's lightweight, only 1.7 lbs compared to some that are 2.5 or even 3! I like that it has a retractable cord, which will make for easier traveling. That goes for the folding handle as well. The HIGH is actually really high powered, I was surprised. And the settings are perfect, in my opinion; the warm isn't too hot (like some I've experienced).|pos
Amazing!! I highly recommend this blow dryer. Not only does it dry my hair in a fraction of the time but it leaves nice and shiny. I feel like I had it professional styled. I have long straight brown hair so flyaways and frizzies are usually a huge issue..but not with this dryer...|pos
The first impression from the wife on this one was that it looked 'pretty'. The hair dryer actually is brownish with pink details, contrary to what the pictures on this page may suggest (Black) It has a very 'girlie' elegant look, so the first impression was great.<br /><br />After using it for a while you can clearly tell this is designed for heavy duty, my wife owns a Conair hair dryer and this one is definitely quieter then the Conair one and more potent. It is indeed heavier but at the same time slim, basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings.<br /><br />Bottom line, a very 'professional' hair dryer, better than the old Conair the wife will no longer use. Additionally an accessory to give volume to the hair is included.|pos
I love this hair dryer so much, I got online to review it...  Of all the dryers I've owned (including a T3) this one dries the fastest and leaves my hair smooth not frizzed.  I'm not saying it's going to perform miracles and turn a rat's nest into a Pantene commercial; but I use to run my straightening iron through my hair just to smooth it out a bit more, and I don't feel the need to do that anymore.|pos
I just bought this dryer to replace the same one I got when I was 16... that was 7 yrs ago. I have long, thick (I mean THICK) hair, and I can get it dry in 5-7 mins with this puppy. It also keeps static at bay. My old one didn't exactly die, but the fan blades were giving out and making a god-awful racket, and I've been holding out for MONTHS because I didn't want to replace it with any other dryer. I found this one here, and I'm SO EXCITED that I get to replace it with the same model!! I can't wait for it to ship!|pos
Purchased this for my daughter and it works fantastic!  Small size but gets the job done. Plenty of power and airflow. Areal winner!|pos
Works well, replaced an older Jerdon wall mount that died. No dangling cords, and difficult to drop and break it!|pos
I've owned a lot of hairdryers in my time (who hasn't?), and this is the first one I can ever recall wanting to review.  I had to buy a new dryer because I left my other one at mom's.  Knowing I'd be home to collect that one (which came from a beauty supply store and works well), I grabbed this one (cheaply) at Target. I think I more or less chose it because it was cute, but I've wound up loving it for more practical reasons.  I very much prefer it to the one it replaced.  One reason is tactile; it has a nice almost-soft finish that's comfortable to touch or hold.  Ergonomically, it simply feels right in my hand.  It's very well balanced.  The cool air option works great; far cooler air (esp for a sustained time) than any other dryer I've owned.  The air opening is a little bit smaller than average, so it provided well directed air.  (There is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct.)  Provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out.  Quickly.  Even on cool air! The cord is NOT retractible, but is is a good length and doesn't seem to tangle easily.  I would recommend this product.|pos
This is perfect! I love that it is really strong, my hair gets dry pretty fast. I also like the 3 different intensities.|pos
I would expect a coil cord to re-coil.  This does not.  It stretched and re-coiled about 50% on the first try. I did not over do it.  I went about 3 feet at most. I can tell by closer examination that it would only get more stretched. What is the point of a coiled cord.  I could simply use a regular dryer with a hook.  I had not mounted it but had one person hold it against the wall for placement evaluation...not to test the cord.  I am returning this defective product.|neg
My family has used this product for approximately 8 years - daily - with no problems.  I even dried 2 small dogs with it regularly.  My mother in her 70s has one, too. It is light weight for her to use. I no longer have a hair dryer or cord all over the counter. It very convenient and compact. The filaments finally burned out, and I am buying another one.  I hope they still make them when the new one stops working.  I figure it to be a $1.00 a year of value, not to mention convenient - nothing to get out or put away!!!|pos
My hairdresser recommended this dryer.  He works in Hollywood and does the hair and wigs of many ladies you have heard of.  This dryer is AWESOME.  Does a great job.  Just don't drop it.  I dropped mine one too many times and had to buy another one which I quickly did.  Now I put a towel in the sink and put the dryer in the sink while I'm futzing with my hair so it won't slip off the counter.  It's so great I am getting my mom one for Christmas whether she needs it or not.|pos
Great item, Lots of power came with a great price point and very fast shipping! I'm completely satisfied, thanks for offering this fine item!|pos
We bought it not long ago, about a month. My wife like it! it has all the features that are needed (hot/cold air, different temperature of hot, ionization that you can turn on/off, different speed) the sound is ok I guess. hope it will work for a long time.|pos
Since this is a Christmas present for my granddaughter, I have no idea how great it is but it has been on her wish list for a long time. The service I received though was wonderful.|pos
This was a gift for my wife who has just longer than shoulder length, thick hair. She really loves it!|pos
The Andis RC-2 hairdryer cuts my drying time in half! I leave the dryer on my dressing table without retracting the cord.  For travel, the cord has retracted with a little bit of help but it is not a problem.  I first used this hairdryer at the Marriott Marquis in NYC and knew then that I had to purchase one!  A great value for the job that it does!!|pos
It's cheap and it works - what's not to love? Full power is pretty strong and gets my hair dry within minutes. The heat is at a good level, not too hot and not cold. There's also a cool button in case you want cool air for a moment. It's also very light, which makes it easier to use and hold, especially if you have crazy hair like I do. Some people have said it's loud, which is true, but it's not much louder than most other hairdryers. I haven't tried the attachments. Overall, it's a good hairdryer and I would buy it again.|pos
I've always been a fan of Conair dryers, but this is the best one that I have ever owned.  I really like the easy open lint catcher and the super strong air flow.  It takes no time at all to dry my hair and the frizziness is greatly reduced.  Highly recommended!|pos
I could not find a hair dryer less than 1850 watts in any stores, so searched the net and found this one.  It's great and doesn't blow the fuse in my bathroom (I have an older home with 15 amp fuses)  My old hair dryer finally gave out and it was also a 1200 watt and now it seemed like no one made anything less than 1850 watts.  This is a wonderful little dryer...a space saver and does the job.|pos
This was not the product I ordered and was disappointed that it cost me $12.20 to return it.   I feel Amazon should have refunded my postage.  I do thank you for the timely return price of the item itself.    Thank you  Pat Savina|neg
Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer.  I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  The hair dryer is great.  So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  Great find--I now have the Ritz of hair dryers!|pos
Finally a blow dryer that leaves my hair frizz free. I've tried Babyliss pro cermaix (not impressed!) and other drug store blow dryers with the ion feature. I have frizzy, thick, coarse hair and a LOT of it. Before blow drying I put garnier leave in, chi silk infusion, and a heat protectant in my hair. My hair is left smooth and for once NOT poofy and frizzy. I love it! BUT I don't think this cuts out on my dry that much.|pos
I purchased my previous dryer from my stylist but it was so heavy I quit using it.  The Pearl Ceramic dryer has the same features but is considerably lighter and works wonders with my naturally curly hair.  It dries my hair really quickly and that is what we use them for, especially in southern humidity! Both the diffuser and the air concentrator are useful for various styles.  I use a little wax mousse and presto! I highly recommend it.|pos
Super easy to mount. Great the cord does not coil because it would get tangled easily. A tad-bit noisy but that's what a hair dryer is, loud. I recommend to all.|pos
Yes, this looks like a hair dryer from a hotel and I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of hotels used this.  It's well-built and light-weight.  Nothing fancy - on/off, high/low air and heat.|pos
This is the third Andis Hangup Hairdryer I have bought and the problem is the same in each one, the switch!  I just bought this last  one less than a month ago and the on/off switch is already giving me trouble. This will definitely be the last one regardless of its convenience.|neg
This hairdryer does what it says it does.  Dries my hair fast leaving it smooth and shiny, quieter than my last dryer, and styles my hair well.  I like the different heat settings because I use it to dry my dog and she needs a low heat blow dry.  I would recommend it.|pos
The folding handle and the retractable cord make this a great travel dryer.  Plenty of power and yet easy to store.  Definitely a good buy.  Have used it for about 6 months and works great.<br />2013:  Still going strong; the retractable cord is not retracting as well as it previously did but the dryer unit works perfectly.|pos
I have to admit, as a guy with short hair, I do not use a hair dryer very often.  However, I am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning.  To me, her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine.  I asked her to give this hair dryer a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair.  The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.<br /><br />My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.<br /><br />The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.<br /><br />My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.  Personally, I love the fact that it is quiet and doesn't wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair (I work the graveyard shift so this is important to me).  So far, this is an excellent product and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.|pos
Bought this as a replacement for an earlier version of the same thing.  The button that you press to start the cord retraction is placed at the widest part of the unit (by necessity) and it got shaved off when closing the vanity drawer so I could no longer retract the cord.  Other than this inherent drawback, I love that the cord retracts for safety/neatness/space-saving, etc.  Dries efficiently without being smoking hot.|pos
I gave this dryer to the missus to try, since she uses one everyday and tears through one or two a year. I figured she'd be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here's what she said:<br /><br />First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn't look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I've been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer. No doubt about it, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer.<br /><br />So of course, we give it five stars.|pos
the is one of the best blow dryer ever, i lov it i would recomended it to everyone...try it you too will love it!!!|pos
I bought this hair dryer to replace one that I borrowed from a friend that burnt out because I used the electric converter incorrectly. Because the price was so reasonable and because I had to reach $25 for free shipping, I bought two and kept one for myself. I use this dryer every day and couldn't be happier with it. My hair is somewhat long (little below shoulders) and this dryer is light, powerful, and drys my hair quickly. It would make a terrific travel dryer. It works much better than those found in most hotel rooms. At this price you can't go wrong. The fact that it has the dual voltage is a nice plus.|pos
The hair dryer has a number of settings and will allow you to have very cool air or very hot air.  It is quite powerful and gets my long hair dry in less time than other dryers I have had in the past.  It is a little heavy and I definitely would not refer to it as compact - it's about the same size as a standard dryer you might get at a drug store and it's heavier as well.  Overall, I'm very pleased with it and hope it lasts a very long time.|pos
I installed this little hair dryer because I was tired of the hair dryer and cord laying on my sink and counter -- it always seemed to be in the way.  My concerns that this hair dryer was not powerful enough turned out to be for naught.  Excellent hair dryer, plenty of power and a lower setting for those who like to take twice as long with their hair (like my GF).  Easy to mount -- love the hook to hang the cord on.|pos
I bought the Conair Blackbird to replace a similar older model that I had for many years.  I know that there a lot of new-tech hair dryers out there. For my needs; I didn't need the new technology.  I wanted to replace my old Conair with a powerful and modern version of the original.  I'm very pleased with the Blackbird.  I'm a male and only blow dry my hair a couple of times a week.  I don't have to use the hottest setting and get great results at a lesser heat level.  The higher heat settings would be perfect for a woman with long hair.  This hair dryer is very powerful and I do a lot of styling on the cool setings as well.          This is the first time I've reviewed a product...I'm so pleased with the Blackbird that I wanted to share.  Starlight|pos
I really am very pleased with my purchase of the Conair 225RX tourmaline Ceramic 1875 Watt hair drier.  It dries my daughter's long thick hair much faster than my old drier.  It produces a nice strong hot breeze, yet it doesn't get too hot that she complains of it burning her (on lower heat seting).  Her hair seems shinier too.  Whole family loves it!!!  Highly recommend it.  The price was reasonable also!!!|pos
I was looking for something compact and light weight and this was smaller than I expected it to be! Does a great job in drying my hair quickly. The high mode is a bit loud but if you don't want to use high, the low option works good too.|pos
Purchased this dryer 2 months ago and it started to make a humming noise about a week ago and within a day is was not working. Seems to me this must have been a refurbished hair dryer because I have my old one that I purchased from QVC 3 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Don't waste your money ordering from this vendor. Something is not right that it worked for only a short amount of time but long enough that I am unable to return it. This is one very disatisfied customer. If I could have given it no stars I would have done so.|neg
I've only had this hair dryer about a month but so far it is excellent.  It is very powerful and  dries my long hair (complete with styling it) in under 10 minutes!  My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch as it's easy to accidentally turn it off while using it.|pos
My hair dresser first started me on a T3 about 4 years ago. I loved it. When it began to loose power, I found another T3 on Amazon and am still a T3 fan. I highly recommend this blow dryer - well worth the money.|pos
I gave this hair dryer to my mom last Christmas. It is the best I have ever used. I don't even use my hair dryer anymore because I love this dryer so much! It dries my hair in what feels like 1 minute. It has three heat settings instead of two, which is nice. This is probably better than the hair dryer my hair dresser uses in her salon! I highly recommend this!!!|pos
I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working.  This is my second T3 hairdryer.  My first one lasted two years.  It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.|neg
The reason the price is so low is that this is a cheap knock off and not a real Bespoke labs blow dryer. Mine stopped working after 9 mths and there is no warranty. You get what you pay for I guess.|neg
This is for all you Dog Bathers. I wanted a dryer that would  match  some of the over-priced professional pet dryers.  This is perfect. It  blows very fast or slow. It's also very lightweight. On cool and warm it's not  too hot.  And it's very quiet compared to  all of the dryers I've ever used. So if you're looking for a dryer for your dog or cat, you won't be  disappointed. And if you happen to  need it for you're own hair it's just fine.|pos
I like the simple design and compact size of this hair dryer. Only the low heat switch of the hairdryer was burned out the first time I turned it on.  The replaced hairdryer is working so far so good.|neg
We purchased two Oster wall mounted hair dryers, model 76932-710s and they failed right out of the box.  Both units made a squealing noise and were throwing sparks out of the fan.  Customer Service at Oster will replace the units but after reading reviews of this model on other suppliers web sites, I am asking for a refund or credit.  The useful life as determined by the other reviews is between 0 to 3 months.|neg
For all the reviewers who complained about cold air. Please press the blue cold air button once to enable hot air. My drier also came with the blue button on, but once I got it off, it worked great. The time I spend drying my hair has decrease considerably! This drier is very powerful and does a great job.|pos
the hair dryer works very well to dry hair fast without harsh heat. you can see the difference in stying compared to a traditional hair dryer.|pos
I have always had difficulty using the round brush and a normal hair dryer to straighten my hair.  My arms would get so tired.  With the Andis 82105 Ceramic Ionic Styler Hair Dryer, I am able to make my spiral curl hair straight in 1/2 the time that it used to.  I have been getting so many compliments on my hair since I bought it!|pos
This dryer works really well, just like the ones in salons. It can get hot in there, but its the same hotness   you would experience in a salon. Heat can be controlled by how deep you stick your head in there. Cord does get   a little warm, but this doesn't seem to be any type of safety issue. This dryer makes it so that you can easily  watch tv or read a magazine while drying your hair. I use them for my dreadlocks and it works great!!|pos
I ordered this hair dryer the begining of August 2010 and it now only works on low speed.  My box is long gone in the garbage and it is past my return refund date. Help!|neg
I had this hair dryer for less than 1 year. The other day it starting shorting out and then suddenly sparks starting flying out of the spot where the cord enters the handle of the dryer, melting part of the cord. Fortunately, nothing caught fire! I replaced the dryer with a non-Revlon product.|neg
I bought this blow dryer for my camper.  It is perfect.  It's compact, hangs on the wall, not loud and does the job.  I would recommend this product for campers, boats, etc.  I will buy another when I burn this one out.  A girl's hair still has to look good, even when you're camping!|pos
I've owned various blowdryers through the years, but this one is my favorite by far. It's relatively lightweight (though I wouldn't say it's featherweight, but it is quite a bit lighter than most dryers on the market), dries hair faster than any other dryer I've used, and generally creates smoother, shinier results. I love that you can pop-off the back and replace/clean the little air filter, since most of my dryers in the past lost power over time because the filter got clogged with dust and I couldn't clean it.     After my most recent cut my stylist gave me a blowout with this dryer, so I knew it was reliable. The way I see it, I wear my hair every day and it surrounds my face, so it's worth investing in a tool that will give me consistently great results that improve my appearance. I highly recommend this dryer!    And by the way, I purchased it from someone on Amazon who was selling a new one for about a hundred dollars. It was a great value and I've had no problems with it!|pos
This dryer works like it should.    The dryer has an ionic on/off switch, which was the only reason we bought it.|pos
This blow dryer did everything they said it would do. My hair looks like I stepped out of the salon with that salon finish everyday! It is shiny like they said it would be and it is not damaging to my hair at all. This is a great blow dryer for someone to use in their home once or twice a day but I would not recommend this blowdryer for salon use because it does start to feel a little heavy after a few minutes so I couldent see a stylist holding this dryer for 8 hrs a day which is unfortunate cause it is a GREAT dryer!!|pos
This hair dryer is extremely loud and uncomfortable to use. It also makes you sit with your face away from the body of the dryer, so it's impossible to work or write while using it. It would have been nice to know this in advance.  All in all It's terrible|neg
BUYER BEWARE!!! This hair dryer has four settings - Off, Low (no heat), Scorch and Torch, a most disappointing purchase from Hot Tools.  There is a positive, the bonnet is much better than one from a prior Hot Tools purchase. Hoping for a short life span for this hair dryer, so that I can buy another brand.|neg
I love this blow dryer...it gets my hair dried fast and has different temperature settings and even a cool blast button.  For those going natural this is a great choice!!|pos
Not much to say here ... this is a small hair dryer perfect for travel; I wanted it to keep in our RV.  I have a lot of hair and it's completely dry in 4 minutes with this little guy.  Very happy with the purchase.|pos
This is the best hair dryer. I usually go for cheap or easy to travel with hair dryers, but decided to try a fair priced ionic hair dryer to protect my hair. I'm so glad I did!! This dryer dries my long hair in about 5-7 minutes and leaves it straight and smooth. I hardly have to use my flat irons; which saves my hair even more from heat damage. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Sometimes the smallest things make the biggest difference!|pos
light weight, effective hairdryer. like the folding handle for travel and storage purposes. retractable cord nice feature. wish it had a cool setting or cold shot button. overall, great dryer at a terrific price!|pos
I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand. It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.|pos
This little hair dryer was just what I was looking for!  It is small and light weight, just right for me.  I also wanted a dryer that was low amperage as my old one kept blowing the circuit! All in all a great price, too.|pos
I am a flight attendant and this travel dryer is powerful!  Better than any hotel hair dryer.  I love it and it's cheap.|pos
I like it so much. Even the button is kind of easy to accidently push, but I don't think it's a big deal.|pos
I recommend this dryer 100%. Really a good product. I dried my hair in only 20 minutes and the appearance was shinny and straight.|pos
This hair dryer is the best I have ever owned. I do not think that it is too heavy, or has a short cord, or too loud.  It all worked out for me. The heat is not as hot as plastic dryers, and I did not have frizz. It held my style in place.  I gave it 5 stars because I am am very pleased with this purchase.|pos
I am very happy with this hair dryer. Its light weight. poweful, but doesn't burn the hair. a great buy for any professional.|pos
This is a great little dryer.  I have fine hair and it's nice that on low it has a nice gentle blow speed and temperature.|pos
Bought this together with the other Andis Tourmaline model. This one is for my daughter. The hairdryer is powerful yet light and we love the retractable cord! It stores away neatly in the bathroom cabinet. We have been using these Andis hairdryers daily for 2 years now and both are still going strong. I have never heard of this brand until I used this in a luxury hotel - I was so impressed with the performance and design of the item that I searched for it online when we got home. For the price, design and performance, this is a great buy!|pos
Very cool and sleak design that I expect from Bed Head.  My hair drys quick and the Ions leave it smooth, shiny, and less 'fried'    AWESOME DRYER!!!|pos
I was so lucky to find this wonderful dryer with diffuser, You see I had one for 20 years, and it finally blew up, I had loved it so much I had to find another one, I was so happy with my purchase. I use it about 10 to 15 times a day, I am a professional hairdresser and have to have good equipment. Thank you for my dryer.|pos
Bonnet size is perfect. 20 minutes is enough to get my hair dry. It's not noisy. It work very well and never turn off.  Bought it was a good decision. I use it while I watch TV or read.|pos
Love it.  Keeps counter space clean, but yet the dryer is handy to use.|pos
I like the three temp. and three levels of air pressure. It makes a big difference I can use it for myself and for my daughter who does not like heat.|pos
I paid an extra twenty five dollars to have the hair dryer shipped a.s.a.p. as I needed it right away. It arrive wrapped in a Priority envelope in the thin box that the hair dryer came in.  I don't know if it was damaged in shipping from poor packaging or if it was damaged before, but it makes an elecricl element noise each time it is turned on and off. It also gets too hot, so I suspect it might have had the thermostat damaged.  The T3 Featherweight Luxe hair dryer is awesome and makes your hair feel much healthier. I am disappointed in this particular one and the way that it was shipped.|neg
I got this blow dryer and returned it within a week. It's a cute dryer, but when I turned it on high and shut it off it would smoke. It wouldn't do it on low, but I still felt it was unsafe. It could have just been the dryer that I got, just be aware if you purchase one.|neg
No bells and whistles on this hairdryer - just an excellent product. Very powerful and light to hold. It arrived very promptly and I recommend it.|pos
i love it, it gets the job done.  it was inexpensive and jsut as powerful as my other hair dryers.  i recommend it for anyone.|pos
[[ASIN:B000RZLL38 Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer]] OWNED THIS UNIT FOR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AND IT QUIT. I CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BUY THIS BRAND EVER !|neg
I bought this dryer expected outstanding results.  It performs no better than any hairdryer I have had.. Matter of fact, maybe not as good...It does not have the blowing power that my   Revlon has, and is not any lighter.  I don't know what all the hype is about this one...Save your money and get a $30 one..I found out they are just as good.|neg
We have owned three of these and none have been reliable. The first arrived with a cord that would not retract. Amazon replaced it and that one lasted one year before it failed. It sounded like broken bits of plastic were inside the fan so we stopped using it. We ordered another and it failed after 6 weeks. The fan speed on 'high' is about what you would get on 'low.'  There seems to be a quality issue here that I advise you to stay away from.|neg
After much urging from my wife, she bit the bullet and spent the extra money on this dryer.  When it was working (little less than a year), she was happy.  When it stopped working, well, not so much.  And it's not as though you can repair these things.  They have no user-serviceable parts, outside of the little grill that your wife's hair accumulates in.  Don't buy the hype, and don't buy this dryer.  You can buy 8 or 9 hair dryers that will work just as well and cost less combined, and die off just as quickly, or maybe even not as quickly if you're lucky.  Why spend the extra money on something that doesn't offer anything extra?|neg
I ordered this item as a birthday gift for my wife 3 weeks in advance. I never received the product, but did get a email with a gift certificate for $0.00. I spoke with the vendor twice, once on the phone and once via chat. Both times the conversations were hard to understand and confusing.<br /><br />Stay away from this vendor. You can get this item at KMart for $14.99 (but shipping was $6.95...pick up at store is $0).|neg
I've had this dryer for five years and have used it everyday! It's still working like new!<br />It retracts nicely and fits great into my bathroom drawer.|pos
We have had this hairdryer slightly over a month and now it only works at low speed. When it worked, it worked great. But just a month before a problem? Unacceptable at any price.|neg
It's too loud, so i didn't used it a lot,(like aroud seven times)the last time i used it, it stop working suddenly and it smells like something just burned, already is in the dumpster.|neg
I place my order on Wednesday September 1st and I was shocked that I already got it today September 4th; I am very pleased with them because I need it the item right away and I got it without paying extra money for rush delivery.  I won't think twice to buy again from them and I Would definately recomend them to everybody.  Excellent Packing and professionally well done.   TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE STARS.|pos
This is the best hair dryer I have ever owned!! It cuts drying time to my longish highlighted blonde hair way down and makes my hair smooth, shiny and frizz-free. My hair looks like I just left the salon everyday!|pos
The hair dryer design itself is good, but the material the cord is made out of is cheap.  After 5 months of daily use, it lost its connection within the wiring, near the end of the plug.  Since it's more than 60 days, I can't return it to the store.  And since it costs me money to ship it back to Conair, AND I have to include another $5.00 for their shipping an new on back to me, I think I'll just toss it in the trash.  I will not waste my time or more money on Conair.|neg
This is my second purchase of this dryer the first one lasted for about 10 years.  The newer model is great I would highly recommend it as I have to many friends.|pos
Hi Gang,  I just threw this Hair Dryer away after having it for about two years. It has begun to smoke and smell horrible. I did some research and found out that Bespoke will do anything to get out of a warranty for this thing. If you bought it here at Amazon they won't touch it.  Hence the circular file...    When it did work, it worked just okay. I didn't like the speeds on the fan or the heat settings. High is too high, low is too low, none of them felt quite right. Save yourself some money and buy the Remington D2012 that they sell here at Amazon. Our new one just arrived. It's got a quieter motor, absolute perfect fan speeds and heat settings, and a true 4 year warranty. Best part? You can buy almost THREE of them for the price I paid for the Bespoke.    If you are looking for a top of the line Hair Dryer then keep looking. The Bespoke has no warranty here and the product really isn't that well thought out in the first place. Look at one of the other offerings and make sure you get a true warranty.|neg
Used this hair dryer at a hotel and loved it -- had to order -- great price -- great travel hair dryer folds nice.|pos
After only using it once I noticed the bristles on the brush attachment have already started to flatten.  I am returning it because I can only imagine what it's going to look like after daily use for only a month.  I noticed another reviewer wrote s/he is looking for replacement attachments.  I'd rather just buy a better quality product to start with.  Also, the power of this hairdryer doesn't even match my cheaper Conair dryer that I bought at the drugstore and was hoping to replace with this more expensive and supposedly better quality hairdryer.|neg
This is a great hair dryer.  Unlike most non-commercial hair dryers, it gets hot enough to quickly dry my hair.  It's weight is typical for dryers this size.  The buttons on the handle are easily avoided once you use the dryer a couple of times.  I also like the color.  I would buy this brand again.|pos
I bought this hair dryer at the BX once I graduated basic training. I love it! I have really thick hair and I've notice that my drying time is cut by half, and its pink!|pos
I purchased the Conair Wallmount Dryer because we absolutely wore out our last one and we loved that one so much that we bought another.  I have these hairdryers in both of our bathrooms and they are so handy because they are right there.  Just pick it up and turn it on and you are ready to go.  Great product.|pos
I purchased one to try. Then two more, the first on failed at at arrival and since I call 32 days after I ordered, not received. It has been used twice! They declined to honor this purchase? I have called five times to only be told there is no supervisor to make a decision? Them they tell me they declined it. But will never call or email back! The product is defective. The handle is burning up and burnt my daughter's hand!    Dissipointed!!!|neg
This hair dryer is wonderful.  Drys my hair much more quickly than the Conair dryer I purchased at Target.  Very sturdy.  Would recommend it as a great investment in hair care.|pos
I asked my hairdresser if dryers made a difference and she went on and on about the one she used- which is this one. She said she even takes it home evenings and weekends to use on her own hair. Bad news- it cost about $350! I wrote down the model and thought i would just see what I could find. I couldn't believe it when I found it on here for under $100! I got it within three days of placing my order and tried it right away. It was truly amazing the difference it made with my hair. I have thinner hair with a natural wave so when it dries it dries more curly and frizzy so I usually use a round brush with a dryer to straighten and smooth it. With this dryer, it was shinier and smoother in half the time. I have been able to come close to how it looks when it is professionally blown out. For all those who don't think a dryer makes a difference - I'm telling you this one did for me. Couldn't be happier with the purchase.|pos
this blow dryer was in a hotel room i was staying at. i fell in love with it it dried my hair so fast it is very powerful i love it!!!!!!!!!!|pos
This Conair Pro is one of the few hair dryers that still uses a squirrel cage blower fan. This type of fan puts out a lot more air than the prop style for the same noise level. This is a Pro quality dryer with a heavy duty motor so it weighs a little more than a regular unit. It does the job fast.|pos
I first purchased the Wall Mount hair dryer for our 5th wheel, and since I have installed them in two bathrooms in our home,    The wife loves them!|pos
I have owned this dryer for about 6 months, and it is the best one I've ever had.  It makes my hair so soft, silky, and bouncy--just like when I get my hair done at the Dominican salons with a blow out.  I have very thick, course, Afro-American hair, and I've always hated blow drying my hair.  It always turned out very dry and brittle--until I used this dryer (or went to the salon).  I found it at Target for under $25, and it's definitely one of the best hair products I've ever used.      I have even tried a few other ionic-tourmaline ceramic dryers, but this one did my hair so much nicer.|pos
For the last couple of months I have researched and read reviews of every hair dryer imaginable on every website imaginable and finally settled on this hair dryer.  And I couldn't be happier!!!  My hair is:    1). Straight  2). Smooth  3). NOT Frizzy  4). Shiny  5). Volumous  6). Looks like I just got a blow out at a salon    Let me start at the beginning.  My hair is shoulder length, somewhere between curly and wavy, tends to be dry and frizzes very easily.  I am typically a slave to the flat iron, but no more.  Here is what I did, step by step to achieve my best hair day ever (that I have done myself- no salon styling included).    1). I washed and conditioned my hair, as usual  2). After towel drying my hair, I used a wide tooth comb to smooth it out and put a dollop of leave in conditioner on the ends.  I then let my hair air dry for about 10 minutes while I putzed around the house.  3). I sectioned my hair and clipped up any hair I was not blow drying at the time.    4). On each section I was drying I put a tiny dot of straightening cream and worked it through my hair.  5). Using a 1.25 round natural bristle brush, I blew each section dry with a downward motion of the brush and dryer.  As I was done with each section, I clipped it away and worked with one section at a time.  It got a little awkward in the back, but I figured I would touch up with the flat iron at the end.  6). There was no need for touching up!  My hair came out great.  I used a dollop of shine wax when I was done drying and shaped my hair.  I finished with a spritz of hair spray.      Even if this hair dryer broke after one use, I would shell out the cash to get another one.  It is that worth it.  I did not have any problems with the buttons that some people said and I did not think it was too heavy to work with either.  What can I say?  I love this hair dryer and I would give it 10 stars!|pos
Very pleased with the product and with Amazon's system. Found the dryer we wanted, paid a reasonable price , and received it quickly. Attached it to the wall easily and found it to work exactly as we wanted.|pos
I just got this dryer last week. You can get burnt with this dryer as the heating vents are placed in odd areas on the bonnet. Also the attachment on the bonnet (the one you hook the dryer tube into) came out completely only a few days after I got it. So I am unable to use. I will not purchase again. I did not purchase from amazon.com but thought the review would be useful.|neg
I reluctantly purchased this hairdryer after reading all the reviews. I didn't really want to spend that much money when there where hairdryers for significantly less.  The good things: quiet and not too heavy.  The bad: the heat from the hairdryer is too hot.  I've been blow-drying my hair for years and have never had to stop because my scalp felt like it was burning.  And, despite the technology it doesn't appear to dry my hair any faster than the old dryer I replaced.  One thing I noticed about the reviews of the dryer was that many people who purchase (and love) this have long hair.  I do not so I'm always drying right around my scalp. Maybe if you have long hair, this might be good for you but other than the quietness, I don't see how this is worth spending so much money on.|neg
I came from other contry. Our contry use only 220 voltage. When I come back to my contry, I want to use this hair dryer. And when I travel abroad, this will be very helpful. Good product!! Buy it!|pos
I know this is expensive, but I feel it is worth the money.  I had a T3 for 8 years and found it to be superior to other hairdryers.  When it finally gave out, I once again checked reports and T3 came out on top.  So now I am enjoying my second one.  Whenever house guests borrow it, they comment on how wonderful it is.  It really does dry my hair faster than other dryers.  I have small hands and found it to be lighter and easier to handle.  My ONLY concern is that the company does not guarantee it if you buy it from Amazon.  However, I read that Amazon will stand behind it.  I never had problems with my last one which worked for 8 years.|pos
I was happy to buy another Elchim dryer.  My first one died after about five years of using it regularly.  I used my T2000 as a spare until I found a good deal on a new Elchim.  Elchim is far better than the T2000.  I have mid to long blond (colored) hair and it dries my colored hair quickly and smoothly.  My hair color covers gray hair which is wirey and dry.  This dryer gives me the look I want for my hair -- long and smooth.  Amazon had the best price on it.  The price was comparable to what my stylist would have paid at a beauty supply store.|pos
I've just purchased this particular dryer of Bespoke Labs and I am very, very satisfied with the results! I've decided to purchase it because cuts down drying time tremendously. I had another ionic dryer and its nothing compare to professional T3. My hair does feel dry at all, no breakage, no frizz. The engineering is fantastic! It does what it claims. I can stay this company creates TRUE CERAMIC, TRUE TOURMALINE composed items. I have relaxed hair and I hate drying it. It takes up most of my time but not anymore! I used the low setting with a nylon bristle brush and I could believe it, flat shiny moist hair. And when used the my flat irons, it straighten very fast--a breeze. Users stay they burn out quickly but it produces salon results each time over. You've already saved hundreds of dollars compared to the times used in total. I will be purchasing their flat irons/ curling irons. I am Bespoke brand loyal now! Then won me over!|pos
My sister bought this hair dryer a few years ago for $200.  One weekend I spent with her, she let me use it.  We both have super thick hair which takes time to dry (about 30 minutes with a regular hair dryer).  Most time, I go out with my hair still wet because I don't like to take the time to dry it, plus I get overheated.  Well, this dryer worked in half the time (or maybe less).  I don't go out with wet hair anymore because it dries so quickly.  It's light and works great, and now the cost is less than 1/2 what my sister paid.  Totally worth the investment!|pos
Purchased this as a direct replacement of the unit mounted in my motorhome from factory.  This is a direct replacement even though the motorhome is 10 years old.  My old unit works great, but latch was starting to fail and handset would fall when traveling, creating possibilities of damage to other parts of bath.  We have used the old one lots and have been perfectly satisfied so we expect the same performance from this new unit, also, the new one looks so much better, 10yr old hair dryers loose their looks too.  The company shipped it fast and all transactions have been great, we are very satisfied.|pos
I ordered two.  The first time I turned it on, it tripped the circuit breaker.  I didn't even try to plug in the second one.  It had features that I liked so I was sorry that it didn't work out.|neg
Handy product for B & Bs and for those who get up in the middle of the night since it has a night light.|pos
I do not do reviews, except when I believe they are needed. In this case, it is needed! I used this dryer for about the past 1-2 years. Not that much trouble out of it. It did overheat. I would let it cool off and begin using it again. Then last week, I was using it and sparks came out of the thing!!! Yes, sparks! I couldn't believe it. I believe that this thing should be recalled, so I contacted Revlon. Revlon wanted no part of it. They told me to contact Helen of Troy. I did that. Now, I am waiting for a reply. I have also contacted the consumer safety commission. I am basically begging for a recall. Please do not buy this hair dryer. After contacting Revlon, I will not buy anything Revlon. (I am David's wife. The Amazon account is in his name.)|neg
I was so excited to receive this hair dryer when it came in the mail!  Well if you have fine straight hair do yourself a favor. Don't purchase this. My  beautiful blond hair is so limp from it that it has become a waste of time using it. I tried numerous times not to put anything in it such as styling  products but it did not make a difference.  My girlfriend who has thick curly hair whom I considered just giving it to her if she liked it said she  didn't like it at all! It's too late to return it which is definitely my own fault. I am looking for something else to replace it with but I am a little  hesitant to purchase over the internet.|neg
This hairdryer is the best I've had yet.  Its not too noisy, its not too weak or too strong and is very lightweight.  I blow dry my hair with a brush and it takes about 15mins and because its so light my arms never get tired.  I would buy it again.|pos
I did not purchase my dryer from Amazon - however after 2years it just stopped working.  Thank goodness I purchased from authorized retailer - I had no issues with the warranty process & received a replacement dryer from T3 (although it did take a couple weeks).  This is a great dryer, I am very happy with it's performance & the warranty process - I rated low to warn Amazon shoppers to make sure when you purchase this item the serial # tag is afixed to the cord - it is absolutely necessary for a warranty situation.  I purchase tons of things on Amazon - I was disappointed to hear of the others having issues since Amazon is not an Authorized T3 retailer.  Make sure you do your research on this one before you decide where to purchase. I would definitely recommend the product itself.|neg
I have used this product before and it is so great that I bought it for gifts. Don't let the price scare you off it is worth every dollar. Your hair will dry in half the time of other dryers but most important it will not damage your hair like most other  dryers. Your hair will stay healthy and will shine.Found the best price on Amazon, it was half the price I found elsewhere.|pos
this product has been awesome so far. it dries my hair quicker than regular dryers. love it!|pos
I read the reviews before making a decision.  The one negative review was wires shorting out..but I know you shouldn't wrap cord tightly around the dryer.  It's powerful and it works!|pos
I was traveling on business and came across this hair dryer at the hotel!  I literally ordered one from my hotel room, immediately after using the dryer.  Works really well! Love the fact that it folds up and has a retractable cord.  Great space saver.|pos
This drier gives me another proof that how Amazon.com helps me find the best product.    Simple design, great quality, compact form factor, for $14 you simply cannot find a better one.|pos
I bought this to bring with me to Europe. The size is perfect and i have long thick hair and this small hair dryer dried my hair pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend!|pos
I never knew a blowdryer could be this wonderful. I should have invested in it years ago and saved all that money on straighteners and fancy products that I bought to compensate for crappy blowdryers. Now I know.|pos
I ordered this dryer specifically for the diffuser shown in the picture. Instead of the diffuser, it came with a cheap hair brush that you could purchase at a dollar store. :/|neg
it does what it supposed to do. don't know what else to say than that.|pos
I have purchased three of these hairdryers for my home and was very fond of the performance until yesterday.  One of the dryers stopped working completely, while another not in the master bathroom outlet.  I called our electrician to see if the outlet was having a problem which it was not.  While plugging in one of the dryers, a huge flame shot out of the GFI plug and burned completely through the cord.  The GFI cord did not work and there was luckily some minimal damange to the walls.  Please be careful and make sure you have a GFI outlet installed in your home where you use this product.  The electrician believed that the GFI on the hair dryer failed and the cord was risky for electrical fire.    Be careful...|neg
I was surprised to see how fast this dryer was shipped. I was looking for a small hand held drier due to haveing RA in both wrists I have a very hard time useing a bigger hand drier. This drier was the perfect size for me.|pos
I've had this dryer for a little over a year.  Worked well, dried quickly and although not small the dryer is lightweight for its size. But just had a huge scare this morning while drying my hair.  The cord literally broke off from the base sending a flare up of fire into the air and exposing the wires! I've had much cheaper dryer's for years and I've never experienced anything like this. Major safety issue and now i have a $100 dryer thats unusable after a little more then a year.  I have a message into Amazon.com but i suspect since its been a little over a year any warranty that was offered is no longer valid.  I'll update this review when i get a response.  (As far as its use, it was used about 5x per week and although it had a long cord I used it right by the outlet so it wasn't stretch or tugged.  The cord did get twisted up much easier then far cheaper dryers and other appliances and this may have contributed to the problem.)|neg
Very light-weight.  Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time my old hair dryer.  The red color is cool!  Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  This is an upgraded version.  I've read that some people think that it's loud but I don't notice it.  Sounds just like the ones in the salon to me!|pos
This item has a wall mount with two flimsy plastic tabs that must fit into slots as the unit is put back into the wall mount.  These tabs are so flimsy that they do not maintain the spacing to fit into both tabs.  It is very difficult to get the unit back into the mount.  Ours lasted only a couple weeks until one of the tabs broke off completely.  The actual unit seems OK but we consider the mount a no go and would not buy this item again.|neg
This hairdryer quit working within one month.  It gets hot, but the blower does not come on - probably a fire hazard.  This is our second one of these, the first quit working within the first year!|neg
The best hair dryer I've ever used. cut my drying time in half and I have a lot of hair!|pos
I love love LOVE this blowdryer! It not heavy... doesnt create alot of heat to damage the hair... Im African American so its hard to find a dryer that wone FRY my hair... it leaves it feeling light and airy.|pos
I am a professional hairstylist. I cant believe how crappy this deal is!  Ordered my blowdryer, got it, knew it was fake almost instantly( I already own a real one), wanted to return it. I called them and told them it was fake and they said I could return it for a refund. They e- mailed a rma# and I sent it back. Well a month has gone by and they claim they havent recieved it and wont even try to help me find it. Yeah right. Total scam because I called them out for being fake. They wanted to exchange but I was adamant on a refund. I guess they didnt like that. Losers. Dont do it!|neg
I moved and left my hair dryer so I ordered a new one the same as I had but improved.  It works good,it is easy to use, and looks better than the old one.  Clark|pos
Just what I wanted/needed...  I read the other reviews to make my decision,  they were right on,,,  Thank you|pos
This is the best hair dryer I have ever bought.  It has cut my drying time in half and it is so much quieter than any other dryer I have ever used.  It was worth every penny!!!!!|pos
I have owned an Andis hair dryer before and loved it- I had to leave it when I sold my home.  I quickly ordered a new one for my present home (a slightly upgraded version) and am extremely pleased.  It is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night.  I would highly recommend this dryer.|pos
A few years ago, I used a First Class hair dryer that was provided in the Marriott Hotel and loved it. When I got home, I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I love this hair dryer! I use it all the time - not just when traveling. It's light-weight so my arms don't get tired, and it blow dries my short haircut very quickly - about 5 mins with styling. I also like that it doesn't have that long blower on it which is harder for me to use for some reason. I saw the review about it not working right in Spain, but I was very pleased with how it worked in Greece. There is a screwlike switch you have to turn for European voltage and I wonder if the previous reviewer did not realize this? When the hair dryer is set to European voltage, there is only one speed (high), instead of the usual high and low, and I was pleasantly surprised that the hair dryer worked perfectly in Greece, just as it did at home - same strength and heat. The only maintenance was to clean the filter with an old toothbrush once in awhile as it would get covered with lint from hair products I use and then the dryer would overheat - but this is something I have to do with any hairdryer I purchase. After being used everyday for about three years, it's starting to sound as if the motor is going and so I'm back to buy another one. My daughter tried mine and liked it so much, she got one also. We both prefer this hairdryer to many other more expensive ones we've tried through the years. I highly recommend this hairdryer!|pos
Its a small blow dryer but it does the job great like a bigger blow dryer would.In this case size does not matter because it does the job.|pos
Very cheap! Not much blowing power and very little heat. I can not recommend this product. I forgot to mention it is also VERY NOISY! Spend a little more money and get you a good one.   David/Ohio|neg
I have been looking for a small, low voltage, hair dryer for some time. Went to Napa with some friends, and this hair dryer was in the Hotel. I used it, loved it, wrote down the name and found it at Amazon.com. Ordered it and it came within days. I have thin hair, and this is best for me.|pos
It is great to have this --- just like the hotels!  A very nice perk at a very reasonable price!  Extremely convenient!  No longer do I need to leave the house with my wet hair because it is somewhat inconvenient to reach my husband's plug-in for the hair dryer...Usually, I would just say 'forget-about-it'!    Love the product!|pos
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS MERCHANT! I ordered this blow dryer 3 months ago and it has already broken. The merchant will not replace it and neither will Amazon because it is past the 30 day warranty. Amazon first told me they would replace it, but then changed their mind. I believe that when you pay over $100 for a product that breaks only a couple months later, it should be replaced. I suspect this product was used and refurbished. My advice would be to buy from a salon or beauty supply store because then you can register it with the manufacturer, which you cannot if you buy it through Amazon. I am very disappointed with this product and the service I received from the seller and would discourage anyone from falling into the same trap I did.|neg
I have always bought Conair dryers.  The one I was currently using was 12yrs old and finally bit the dust!  So I decided to buy the Silverbird.  Wow, my hair is below the middle of my back and usually took 20 minutes to dry.  With the Silverbird, it took 7 and my chemically treated hair was SO shiny and smooth--I can't quit touching it haha.  Definitely worth it, and to think I almost dropped $100 on a Solano.|pos
Bought this for my wife for Christmas and she has been using it on daily basis. I am glad that she loves it.|pos
When my old Remington dryer that is 7 years old broke I started looking for a replacement, needless to say I ended up returning 4 dryers before I found this one. I loved my old dryer because it was so quiet, I can't stand the dryers that have a high pitched whining noise. So I called Remington & they told me this was the quietest dryer they make (they measure by decibels & this dryer had the lowest). So I bought it & it is super quiet, the motor doesn't really give off any noise the only sound you hear is the airflow. And the airflow on this dryer is super strong, its much stronger than my last dryer so it does dry your hair pretty quick. I am very pleased with this product. It comes with a 4 year warranty too. The hot setting is hot but its nice because it doesn't get hot enough wear it feels like its burning your scalp. I actually bought mine at walmart online for $27, it was such a great deal! I highly recommend this dryer, its great.|pos
My daughter recently bought this hair dryer and let me dry my hair with it.  It dryed my thick shoulder length hair in  a little over 5 minutes. I love it.  My hair has a little wave in it, in the wrong places, and this straightens that out if I use a wide round brush with it. It does get rid of the small amount of frizz I have.  My daughter has long, frizzy, thick hair and she found this dryer to dry quickley and smooth down her hair.|pos
My last one was a Sunbeam, it lasted 2-3 years. My latest Jerdon stopped working after 6 months. Bummer. It sparked then stopped completely. the dryer didnt have anything preventing it from working (no build up). I plugged it in recently and the lightest setting works but that's it.|neg
I bought this to take on Spring Break and it was great! It was very humid in Cancun and it dried my hair very fast. I have shoulder length hair and it dried it in about 3 minutes. It is great that it folds up, it makes it nice and small to fit in my tiny bathroom drawer. The cord retracts correctly MOST of the time, but can be pushed in manually. I keep this dryer in my bathroom and my gigantic, expensive one in my bedroom, I much prefer this one!|pos
I love this little blow dryer.  It drys my hair super fast, light weight, is up and out of the way,  and a great price.  Buy more than one, and give as a gift !|pos
Great price and it works great too.  Keeps bathroom neat and counter clear. It has a very short cord that runs to the outlet which can be good for some and bad for others. I really like the three speeds . I'm going to order another for our other bathroom.|pos
Like many others, I have always used cheap hair dryers from Target or the drug store and assumed most hair dryers were the same. My husband always complained about how loud they were and how long they ran for so he bought me the FHI Nano Pro for Valentine's Day (in pink of course). It is amazing and so much more quiet! My thick hair dries in half the time and has much more sheen to it. It has also cut down on the amount of time to flat iron it and extended time between washes. I think I will be adding the FHI pro flat iron to my collection too! I would highly recommend it even thought it is more money than I ever thought I would pay for a hair dryer.|pos
These were purchased for a vacation home. I wanted something that could be mounted off counter - like in a hotel.  They seem to work well, but I don't know how long they will last, with renters. Only time will tell.|pos
I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago and really love it.  I had read the reviews about the cord not being a spiral stretch cord and that is why I bought this one.  I have a linen closet next to my vanity and there is a plug-in inside the closet.  I hang the dryer in there out of sight so when I take it out to use, it has a much longer cord then a spiral cord and I need the extra length to reach my vanity so it works perfect for me.  So if you are looking for the spiral cord do not buy this unit, but if you need a longer cord this is the one for you.|pos
Excelente! This dryer is light, strong, it makes hair shine, cuts half of the time of drying. I'm a professional and I definetely recomend it for professionals.|pos
I have been wanting a wall mounted hair dryer for a long time and this was the only one I found that had a cool setting. At least I thought it had a cool setting since the cool button is pictured and it is in the description, but when it arrived today it was the same model # that I ordered but the product is not the same. Very disapointed.|neg
Very disappointed! This dryer puts out little air and is so lame compared to my old Chi! Also, please beware: This company does not recognize Amazon as a real company. They will not allow you to register the dryer even though it has all the registration information and numbers. The company is not user friendly ... and, unfortunately, neither is the appliance! Stay away from the T3!!!!|neg
I purchased this dryer for my husband for X-mas it worked well for about 2 months and then started to spark at the cord. My husband took it apart and the cord inside was black,not good. Thank goodness it didn't start a fire!!|neg
This hair dryer is a waste of money!  Purchase a Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler - $34.99  OR  Andis 1875 Watt Professional Ceramic Ionic Hair Dryer - $39.99  Works better and saves you a heap of money.  This dryer is NOT worth $139.99!!!|neg
This is a great color and an unbelievable price for this product.  It's quieter than my last hair dryer, which is a huge bonus.  It does smell funny when drying for about the first two weeks, but then it's fine.  I've recommended this hair dryer to others I know.|pos
I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use.  From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak.  After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.    Do not buy this model.|neg
Avoid this hair dyer!  It caught fire only after a couple of months use.|neg
They last only about 30 days. Only using about 15 mins a day. this is the second one. I will not buy again.|neg
The heating element in this hair dryer stopped working after three uses. I am in a protracted effort to get a replacement, although from reading other reviews it does not appear that the replacement will be any better than the original. Do not buy this hair dryer! It is unreliable.|neg
It's expensive, but worth every penny, it seems. Has an extra long cord. I don't know what all the fancy technological issues are but when my wife says I love it it gets five stars. The cheap hair dryers we used to buy would work for a few months then die - this one seems to be made to last for years.|pos
I think pretty much all has been said in the above reviews. It dries hair quickly, but doesn't damage it by being too hot, nor does it make it frizzy. It is not too loud - it is not exactly quiet, but nothing dramatic. It is not too heavy either. And it's a good deal! I have had it since a month and I actually go through the trouble of blowdrying my hair much more often now, because my hair looks so nice now. (Well, not that I was a monster before).|pos
The removable lint screen makes this dryer a rare find.  I got so tired of trying to clean out my previous dryers, knowing that the air starvation would otherwise cook the insides and cause early failure.  The high air flow is also a plus.|pos
I first discovered this well-functioning hair blower at a hotel where I was staying.  The lightweight, sleek design hair styler seemed to have a higher heat output at a lower wattage than any models I had owned.  I purchased one from Amazon when I returned home and as usual, received my items in record time.  The hair styler is a pleasure to use and I especially like the heat options and focus of air (without attachments) that allows me to get the job done efficiently.|pos
...but that is all the positive I can say about this. I bought one of these tonight at a local store to replace my dead Conair - folding handle, retractable cord were what sold me originally. However the cord is not long enough to get to the top of your head (it is half the length of my previous dryer). I couldn't find any info on how long it was supposed to be but I couldn't seem to get it out any further.     The switch is impossible to work with an arthritic thumb. You shouldn't have to use two hands to turn the thing on or off!    NOISE! WOW! Loud and irritating! This thing is going back tomorrow. Obviously not a Happy Camper with this purchase.|neg
I love this lightweight blow dryer it is fantastic and it is super quiet and doesn't frizz my hair out. The plug fits into my outlet well, my last blow dryer it hogged u to plug spaces. After reading some reviews on the T3 and hair stylist using this product I committed. It is pricey but worth it to me.|pos
This is my second Andis, it worked so well when it gave out I ordered another one this past February.  Hopefully it'll last as long as the first one.  A great deal for the price.|pos
I bought 2! One for the master bath and one for the kids bath. It has helped with the clutter in the kids bathroom soooo much! And since it's out all the time it reminds my girls to dry their hair.  I LOVE it! I would recommend it to anybody with kids.|pos
I spent over $100 for a hairdryer.  I used it twice and had to return it because it had no heat.  I wasn't impressed for over $100.|neg
I have had this hair dryer for a few years, and it has served me well up until now. Just this morning I was blow drying my hair when sparks began to fly out of the dryer, into my hair and onto the floor. In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it's end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase. Please stay away from this hair dryer unless you want to be scared out of your wits when you least expect it and risk burning off a part of your hair (or carpet).|neg
I spent a lot of time comparing the features and benefits of different hair dryers before buying this one. I have a Babyliss and like it, but wanted to try something new. I didn't see a big difference initially, but when I used this and the Babyliss on alternate days, I was amazed at how quickly the FHI drys my hair. I can exercise in the morning before work because this cuts down the amount of time I need to get ready. It is lightweight and quiet, and I  hope that it lives up to its claim to have a longer life.|pos
It does everything it says it will - nice drying, not too hot, very even, and the attachments work well.  The heat is very even and it does a good job.  This is kind of a cadillac of hair dryers for people who want to pamper their hair.  I love it!|pos
I got this as a second hair-dryer for traveling and to leave at my boyfriend's house so I didn't have to lug my Conair 213X Infiniti Pro (about $40, and much heavier than this one) back and forth every weekend.  This was a great choice.  The dryer is much much lighter than what I'm used to and has a nice smooth feel (as in, it doesn't feel light plastic under my hands, but more of a rubbery-feel - very pleasant!).  It is also just as powerful as the 213x.  It has 2 speeds (gale-force wind and normal), and 3 heat settings.  I use the gale-force winds on medium heat and my hair 4-5 below my shoulder, thin-medium thickness, is dry in under 3 minutes.  My younger sister tried it out and put it on gale-force high heat and she said it didn't stay on for more than a few seconds.  My thoughts are it could have been my outlet (I live in a very old apartment building - circa 1900s) unable to handle the current flow OR it could have been a safety feature of the hair dryer to prevent over-heating.  Either way its not a problem for me since high heat hurts my head and ears and makes me feel as if I'm destroying my hair!  All-in-all its a great value for the price.|pos
I didn't know what the attachments were for so I threw them out.  I turned it on and it blew hot air.  5 stars.|pos
This drier has been working great for me for the last few months and I'm pretty sure I am using it harder than most.  I have it out at the barn with my horse and use it it dry him off after a workout and a bath.  This means that while it is only working on short hair, it has a lot of surface area to cover and it holds up the whole time.  Only bad thing I have to say is that the less than ideal environment with lots of dirt has caused me to see a fleck of rust or two on the front grill, but they don't  seem to be spreading and they haven't given me any trouble.|pos
I originally bought this model hangup hair dryer because of the cord hanger. In all honesty, I never use the hanger. I leave my cord dangle. It actually helps to detract from the power cord that runs to the outlet. If I hang the cord, I actually feel like that just spreads out the cord mess. That may be something to consider if you are buying this model for the cord hanger.    The nighlight is not as bright as some of these reviews would have you believe. If you go from having a completely dark bathroom to having this light, you will notice the room is much brighter at night, but the light is no brighter than any other night light.    You will need the right size allen wrench to switch the dryer from 1200W to 1600W as this does not come with the dryer.     I had no problems with the screw length for mounting as others have stated, so they may have fixed that problem.    This dryer is much quiter than my previous dryer which was an 1875W regular handheld model. It's not silent, but it is quieter than any dryer I've owned.    Even though this and other wall mounted dryers have lower wattage, I don't notice a significate increase in drying time (maybe a minute or two). I actually prefer the lower wattage now because I'm not blasting my hair (or scalp!) with heat which tended to cause split ends and fry my hair after continued use (I don't curl or use a flat iron, so the difference is purely a result of the hair dryers). Also, once I finish blow drying, my hair looks like it will for the rest of the day (an moderate amount of volume), whereas with the 1875W dryer, my hair would be a pouf ball first thing in the morning and gradually flatten to my head by the end of the day.     Other notes: The dryer itself is a medium size. I like that it's not one of the tiny ones because I feel like it's not flimsy and weak (even if smaller ones really aren't). It's also not as big and heavy as full sized dryers, so I find that I move it around much more and get more even drying.|pos
I upgraded from a Gold N Hot 1200 for this one as was so excited to try it. Unfortunately, like the rest of the 1 star reviews, the dryer frequently overheats and then POP! it stops working.|neg
I bought this dryer because my hairdresser has one like it.  I have naturally curly hair that I straighten. This dryer is awesome.  It dries hair quicker than most, leaving no frizz in the hair.  My hair feels smoother and healthier after using it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.  Some of the reviews that I read on here before purchasing, said that a lot of people didn't like the controls because their hand would hit it and just turn it off, I don't understand this, if you hold it in your hand the right way, it works fine without hitting the controls.|pos
This product is of good quality for a very good price. Also  lightweight and not too noisy.|pos
I usually love Amazon and buy a lot of Cd's, books, etc. Don't buy this hairdryer from any discount supplier. I bought one, expected a genuine article, didn't get a manufacturer's warranty and am stuck with a dryer that doesn't get hot. I contacted the seller, and because I was certain this was authentic, I threw the box away and now I'm on the hook for $100 plus. DO NOT BUY from anyone other than a seller who can provide a warranty from the manufacturer. These dryers have a tendency after a couple of years to burn up. My last one shorted right at my vanity. Scary. Get the warranty. Please.|neg
We bought the T3 Featherweight through Amazon less than a year ago. The dryer died yesterday. I contacted T3 and they stated that they would not honor their warranty because Amazon was not an authorized dealer. They offered to replace the dryer for $50.00. I advised them I would let Amazon know that the dryers they are selling are not backed by a warranty because they are not an authorized dealer.  Sounds like a bunch of manure to me.|neg
My blow dryer broke after less than 3 weeks of sporadic use. I thought it was great at first, but was very disappointed that it broke so quickly.|neg
$100+ is a lot to pay for a hair dryer that only lasts for 9 months. Don't bother. If you want to spend the money on a high-end hair dryer, make sure it has a guarantee. This one does not.|neg
I bought this product almost 3 years ago.  It is so nice to be hands free and feel confident it will stick to the counter (or glass).  I recently bought it as a gift for my mom.  She loves it.|pos
Fits the bill perfectly. I sought a small, efficient hair dryer that could hang up in my very small bathroom and be unobtrusive but effective.  The cord - hanger is a plus, allows the coiled cord to be placed out of the way.  I disagree with some reviewers who found it very noisy on high setting. This dryer is just fine.|pos
I saw this at my sister in laws, she has one in each bathroom and loved it. Its out of the way and always neat looking. It has lots of power for no bigger than it is and just a nice addition to my bathroom, convenient but out of the way also. Power cord is long enough but not too long. Love it, love it, love it!!|pos
This hair dryer has worked wonders. I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed to natural and this product creates lovely results. Leaves hair straight with a lovely sheen. Also, it takes maybe 5-10 minutes to dry hair!|pos
This hairdryer is fantastic. It is powerful, which means it dries fast, lightweight, and includes many different settings. The extra attachments also help for different types of drying. Although other reviews say it is heavy and bulky, the Andis hairdryer is far from it. I would recommend it for anyone.|pos
I was looking for a dryer that was NOT an ion dryer or ceramic, these days that is NOT that easy!!!! I came across this one, had a few good reviews so I thought I'd give it a try....I'm so glad I did! I've had this dryer for a little over 2 years....no problems. I use it every single day with a big diffuser on it. I have naturally curly thin hair and must use a diffuser...this dryer works perfectly for me. At first I didnt think I'd like the smaller size but quickly got over that, now I love it I take it everywhere!  1600 watts is perfect. In fact I love this dryer so much I just bought a second one just in case....!!!! Try it you will not be disappointed!|pos
I bought this for my wife with her long,thick hair because she always complained about how her rotary style hair dryer wasn't powerful enough. I was at my barbershop and noticed this was the model my barber used and it blew strong hot air so I decided to get her one and she loves it.|pos
I got this for my sister. She absolutely loves it. She does a lot of traveling and is used to a   hairdryer like this.|pos
I bought this hair dryer as a Christmas present for my girlfreind.  She says its the best hair dryer she has ever owned.  I highly recommend.|pos
My husband (firefighter) had a nasty habit of leaving the blowdryer on the bathroom counter until it cooled off.  Everytime I walked into the bathroom, there'd be the clean counter with the blowdryer sitting on it so I'd wind up the cord and put it in the cabinet. EVERYDAY.  So for Christmas, I got hubby this blowdryer and we all love it.  Colors are not too white, more ivory and light taupe, but very neutral.  The kids can all use it easily (5 yrs and up), simple on/off button on the base, hi/lo on the dryer handle and it gets put away -- right away.  It took five minutes to hang, we plugged it right into the outlet and I love it!|pos
I am very happy with this dryer.  All the settings and attachments let me do almost anything with my hair.  I have a bad right arm and can't use curlers so this really helped me look presentable!|pos
Excellent dryer leaves hair puffy and doesnt feel damaged best dryer I have ever used!|pos
I bought this hair dryer because I have the larger version that I use at home and I wanted the same quality for when I travel.  This packs well and I love the retrackable cord.|pos
Did a lot of research on blow dryers and settled on this one based on positive feedback.  Totally worth the money.  Dried my hair and made it a lot straighter than my old dryer and only took half the time!|pos
I've been looking for a dryer for quite some time and was getting close to ordering a $200 dryer (but just couldn't see actually spending that on a hair dryer).  But low and behold I took a chance on this one and absolutely love it!  I have wavy/curly hair that is very prone to frizziness and this has seemed to tame some of that chaos and makes straightening my hair really easy.  It has cut my drying time down by a few minutes, is quiet, and throws out a lot of air.  Compared to my last hair dryer this is like a little bit of heaven in the morning!  I would definitely recommend.  Also, it has a 4 year warranty; can't go wrong with that!|pos
The Conair 1875 hair dryer is powerful and quiet.  I'm very satified with this purchase.|pos
This is a great hairdryer for the price.  Dries my hair quickly, is lighweight, and easy to use.  I bought two - one for my wife and one for me.  She likes it as much as I do.  Great purchase!|pos
WE USED THIS HAIR DRYER IN A HOTEL ONCE AND LOVED IT SO MUCH WE HAVE ONE IN EVER BATHROOM (7) IN THE HOUSE...  WE LIVE AT THE BEACH SO WHEN WE HAVE COMPANY THEY USE THE HAIR DRYERS AND THEY LOVE THEM..  TWO OF OUR FRIENDS LIKED THEM SO MUCH THEY BOUGHT ONE FOR THEIR HOUSES.......  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THE HAIR DRYER WITH THE NIGHT LIGHT, THE LIGHT WON'T LAST LONG, JUST BUY THIS ONE IT'S THE BEST........|pos
Okay, how could I have lived 63years and never thought of installing a hair dryer on the wall?  It's a no brainer!  Dragging out the hairdryer every day and trying to put it away neatly is a hassle and there is no reason to put up with it any longer!  I bought 2 Oster 76932-710 and put one up in my bathroom and the other in the spare bath.  Now when guests come over they compliment me for the nice hotel upgrade.  Everybody comments on what a good idea.    The 710 watt Oster is a great dryer and does the job well on my thick hair.  The dryer snaps easily in and out of the holder.  It took me about 30 minutes to install both dryers...and that included the time it took me to find my drill and try and read 3/16 on the drill bit!  Buy this...it will only make you happy!|pos
I purchased this dryer at Target for $20.  I use only Conair dryers, and know that it is a matter of trying until I find the right one for me when the old one dies.      This one is so loud that it hurt my ears.  I know that I could have gotten used to it, but decided that it was best not to try.    I have thick and fine hair and for some reason the ion dryer really zaps my hair- diminishes the shine.      This dries quickly and thoroughly, but the noise and damage to my hair are not worth it.  I will go back to a regular Conair.    I love the brand, but just not this item.|neg
I have tried a lot of hair dryers in the last 40 years. This one is, by far, the best I have used. It is pricier than the ones you see in the discount stores, but it is worth every penny you pay for it. I recommend it highly.|pos
I've had mine for a year and a half, it still works great. Turned out to be a great purchase.<br />3/17/2013 It's been over 3 years and it still works like new.|pos
After years of having my hair dryer clutter up the vanity, I now have a very nice dryer attached to the wall.  Be sure to have near plug in as the cord is short.  Love this for organization, and it works very well.|pos
To clarify the warranty situation, I called discountjungle for information including how they managed to sell this product for 91 dollars- here it is    amazon covers this hairdryer for only 30 days under their warranty    discount jungle covers this product for a full year- if you have a problem within the year, discountjungle will call T3 and handle the warranty claim for you    The reason it is only 91 dollars is b/c of the warranty w/ discountjungle only being 1 year, instead of the full 4 year warranty through an authorized dealer|pos
I didn't want to spend a lot of money for a new blow dryer because I don't straighten my natural hair too often. I read a lot of reviews before deciding to buy this Conair blow dryer. OMG!!!! =D   I am a Black woman with very thick, curly/frizzy, coarse, mid-back length hair and it always takes a long time (~1-2 hours) and a lot of energy to blow dry my hair, even at the salon! But NOT with THIS DRYER!!! I cannot believe it. I've only had it for a month now, but I'm thinking that there isn't a better blow dryer out there for the price. I parted my damp hair into 4 quadrants and used the comb attachment included. It only takes 4-6 passes from the scalp to the ends of each entire section to be completely dry and straight. And it feels so smooth and soft. Unheard of for me. I almost don't need to flat iron afterwards. Seriously!   My daughters and nieces will be getting these as gifts from me this year.  ;D I am VERY happy with this purchase.|pos
This is our second unit after 10 years of daily service.  The original unit worked fine until the internal fan that pulls air through the unit shattered.  We mounted a 2nd unit on the same wall bracket in about 5 seconds and are again happy campers.|pos
Wife wanted good hair dryer.  I know nothing about them.  I poked around on the internet and read lots of reviews.  People were very positive about this brand and version.  It is a professional grade high quality dryer and she loves it.  She was not familiar with the brand previously.  The only thing to consider (and not a big deal) is that the power cord is longer than a typical home cord as it seems to true that this is used by professionals.  Not a big deal, but so you know it does not have a little curled up cord.|pos
I bought this for my daughter and am very pleased with my purchase. It is an amazing hair dryer that literally makes your hair softer.I would recommend this to anyone.|pos
I bought this as a gift for my daughter who is in nursing school. she loves anything that is pink and has the Breast Cancer logo. She said this is the best dryer she has ever had,dries her hair in half the time. She said she loves it,and that it is a great dryer.|pos
Couldn't be more impressed with a blow dryer! The color jumps right out at you; the 2 speeds are average and the heat options work great. Heats up really fast & on high is probably too hot for some. Have medium short hair, so no need for attachments, but I'm sure they would function well if you need them. Can't say enough about the color lol!|pos
This is the only hair dryer that I have used since I purchased it. It has a powerful motor, which means you get a very forceful air current. It pretty quiet, and this dryer can put out ALOT of heat, so sometimes I find myself turning the heat setting down or moving it further from my head because it can get uncomfortably warm. The first one I had lasted over three years, and would have lasted longer if I had been a little less clumsy with it. To be honest, the only real drawbacks that I find with this dryer is that it's a little heavier than a cheaper hair dryer, and a little more expensive, but very worth it.|pos
This is very good. I like it. I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style. awesome!|pos
Worth evey single penny. does not burn hair. Would order another one in a minute if it broke. I will never buy another cheap blow dryer again.|pos
my wife and I have used this product for at least 10 years every day and it finally wore out so I had to buy a new one.|pos
This week, our second Andis wall mounted dryer burned out.  After our first failure, I always checked and cleaned it out on a regular basis.  Prior to complete unit failure, the internal thermal protection would turn the unit off prior to my wife finishing her hair.  It would typically work again the next day.  The first one lasted about 3 month, the second one about 8 months.  I have another model from a different manufacturer in my bath and it has worked for over 10 years.  We purchased this one because of the claim to produce less noise (not really) and the night light.  The night light could be too bright for some, but it was OK for us.  I just order another wall mount from a different manufacturer.  In less than 1 year, I will be $120+ for one hair dryer.  Not good value.  Plus, I am sure I'll have to make new mounting holes and, patch and repaint over the old ones.|neg
I have very long, thick blonde hair. Usually I don't have the patience to blow-dry my hair. I have been using the same hot pink Conair blow-dryer for about 3 years and it takes at least 20 mins to get my hair completely dry. I used this Andis product at a hotel I stayed in in NYC and loved it! It dried my hair in less than 10 minutes. I wrote down the brand name of the blow-dryer and bought it on amazon.com the day I got home from my trip.<br />I have already recommended it to all of my girlfriends!|pos
Used it for about a year now, have had no problems! It was easy to install and works great! Keeps counter clear and is ready to use.|pos
I love this hair dryer!  On vacation I used my sisters & was so impressed that once I got home, I went online & ordered it.  This hair dryer is the best I've ever bought, and I've had plenty over the years.  Most hair dryers have a high pitched whine when on high. This one is very quiet, almost whooshing it dry.  Also, my hair is smoother than it's ever been after being dried. Could it really be the fact it is tourmaline or ceramic?? No matter, I would highly recommend this brand and this model!     Buying it through Amazon made it much easier since I didn't want to go through the hassle of looking for it, not knowing which stores carried this exact model.  Price was very competitive.|pos
I tried this blowdryer at Kimpton Hotels in San Francisco-- forgive me -- it blew mind!!!!  I have long curly hair that I straighten as I blowdry using a large metal brush. Normally, this is a 20-30 minute painstakingly long process. This blowdryer reduced my drying time to 7 minutes!!  7 minutes!!!! The hot air is VERY HOT, the high speed is VERY HIGH. I loved this product so much I texted myself the name of it and bought it when I got home. Can't say enough... It does overheat, so if you turn it off between sections of hair or something... you might have to wait until it cools a little. But to save 15-20 minutes of my life from blowdrying hell, it's worth it!!|pos
I have two teenage girl's and we have really put this blow dryer through the test. It works great and dries our hair quickly without the frizz. Would highly recommend!|pos
First, I was very much unimpressed by this hair dryer. Given its price, I was expecting something significantly better than a 20 dollar dryer -- NONE. And it's no featherweight, it's heavier than my previous one.    Second, I found that I couldn't register this product because its lack of the serial number. Though on the manual, it specifically says if the serial number is missing, it might not be authentic. So here goes the warranty comes with the bespoke itself. But I reasoned it must still be authentic since it's sold by amazon..      Third, I went to sephora and found this one on shelf. Man, the one in sephora, though looked exactly like this one I had, but it's real featherweighted -- just by this, I didn't even need to try out the functionality of that one in sephora to understand I have got this fake one from Amazon.    Amazon tried to charge me restocking fee for this one that is fake. I need a resolution!!    Please don't buy, it's fake.|neg
I looked in the usual stores to replace my other Oster Wall Mounted Hair Dryer we've had for about 10yrs and could not find this item.  We all love the convenience of not having to store it anywhere and always have it handy next to the vanity where it is needed.  It is a great product besides.  I definitely will re-order this again.|pos
I've had the Conair Ion Shine 1875 for about 6 months and haven't been particularly unhappy with the dryer. I wouldn't even be writing a review if I hadn't burned my fingers on the plug this morning. I have very thin, fine hair and don't need to use the blow dryer more than 3 minutes in order to dry my hair. There's absolutely no reason for the prongs on the plug to heat to the point that they become a branding iron. I let the plug cool down and checked it in another outlet to be sure the problem lay in the dryer and not in the electrical outlet, and the prongs heated to the point of burning in under a minute.    Needless to say, the dryer went straight in the trash. (After the plug cooled down.) I'll be saving my receipt for the next dryer (which won't be a Conair) that I purchase.|neg
Superfast shipping.  Item arrived in new condition as described. Very nice hair dryer. Very powerful.  I was a bit concern about the life of this product but so far so good...|pos
Normally it takes me 1/2 hour to dry my long hair, but now only 15 minuites with this FHI 2000 hair dryer. Also, my hair is silky to the touch afterward.  The weigh of this dryer I feel a little bit heavy at first, but it's solid.  I bought this dryer in pink color before, and this black one is for my sister as X'mas gift.  I hope she will like it as much as I do.  Great service from Amazon.  Fast delivery-about a week.  Nice packaging-no damage at all.  Thank you!|pos
I bought this dryer about a month ago exclusively for travel, but I like it so well that I've been using it for my regular one.  I like that the retractable cord keeps my counter looking uncluttered, but it doesn't always retract as easily as it should.  I sometimes have to coax the cord back in the handle, but to me, it's a tolerable hassle (especially for the price point).  The dryer is very powerful.  I have a ton of hair and the wattage really minimizes the time it takes me to get my hair dry.  The ceramic element also minimizes the static I experience with most other hair dryers.  Overall, it has a few flaws, but for $19.99 it's a heck of a dryer.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have had this over a year now and it's still going strong after daily use.  Love this thing!|pos
This was definitely worth the purchase! It dries faster than normal hair dryers. Best of all, I have had a ton of compliments on how shiny my hair is since I started using it!|pos
I bought this hair dryer to replace my previous Hot Tools hair dryer that had broken after many years of use. This hair dryer is even better than my old one! It is much lighter and still has the same fast drying power of the last one. I take it everywhere because no other hair dryer can dry my long layered hair as quickly and easily.|pos
I replaced a Conair 1600 which was used daily for several years and finally died. I bought this based on the numerous good Amazon reviews and because some have said that the 1850 watt dryers might not work outside the U.S.  Delivery was swift. The dryer feels substantial and well built. It dries more quickly than the old Conair without hair looking like I stuck my finger in a socket. As was mentioned before, this will dry anything short of a wookie very quickly. Highly recommended.  10/19/10: Just received a second Andis 33805 ordered 6 days ago as backup in the event this model 33805 is discontinued. The original has performed flawlessly and continues to feel well built.|pos
Dual voltage perfect for travel.  Wonderful size and perfect heat...not too hot as some can be.  I make my daughter bring this one when we travel since I love it so much and I leave mine old clunky one at home.|pos
I'm sure this hair dryer could have been great.  I loved my Yellowbird but unfortunately, this Blackbird would not power on.  The original hair dryer got to me in a matter of days but the replacement was going to weeks so I had to cancel it and get a refund.  Bummer!|neg
I bought this dryer strictly to use for deep conditioning my hair after reading the reviews that it didn't work well for drying hair.  It worked beautifully for this the first two times I used it, I just hooked it up to use for the third time and it worked for about 15 seconds (I started on the cool setting) then shut off...I tried other outlets in case that was the issue.  It is a dead dryer.  I'm very disappointed in this product.|neg
I also first tried this product while on vacation.  This little hair dryer is compact, light, and powerful.  The best part, however, is the service I got from this vendor!  My order was filled right away, I got it within days, and the price was the best I found by far.  Thanks, Jen!    Anita  Stratford, CT|pos
From the start I wasn't totally happy with this hair drier, but decided to make do anyway.  (Too much hassle to return it.)  The toggle switch was difficult to use and when I wanted curls in my hair, for some reason I couldn't make it work as well with this one.  (Do the ion driers straighten the hair?)  The higher speed/temperature is too hot, but the lower one takes too long to dry my hair.    The worst of it started about two months ago when it started slowing down after a minute or so of use.  I didn't think much about it other than realizing I'd probably need to replace it soon.  Then this morning as I was drying my hair, I happened to see it in the mirror as it slowed down.  It was throwing sparks when it slowed!  I was lucky my hair hadn't caught fire!  Needless to say it has been discarded, and today (Thanksgiving Day) I have one more thing for which to be thankful - I was protected from a fire.|neg
This is the second unit I've puchased like this, was very pleased with the first one. Very handy, no worries about plugging it in since it's hard wired to begin with. The first unit is about five yrs old now with perfect performance...    Tops St. Louis|pos
I ordered the product pictured (Andis 1600W wall mount hair dryer) to replace a similar unit that I have been very happy with.  I was sent a different product that does not match the pictured product and has multiple cords protruding from the base and is unusable to me.  Amazon's rules are that it has to be returned unopened and I ripped the packaging before I realized the wrong product was sent.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.|neg
After 3 1/2 months after purchasing this hair dryer, the unit has burned out.  This was not the first time I have experienced this same problem with this same dryer.  A year ago I purchased the same dryer and the had the same problem.  Would I ever buy another Andis product...NO!|neg
This is an excellent blow dryer! I read the reviews before purchasing about how it didn't work right out of the box. Same thing happened to me, except that I realized that if you press the red RESET button on the plug, it works just fine. My hair dries faster, without over-drying. Great price, too!|pos
The dryer works like a charm and is just what we were looking for. I'd recommend it for anyone who doesn't want a hair dryer just lying around on their countertop.|pos
I have natural, color-treated, kinky- curly, african american hair. A co-worker recommended it for blow outs.(She's used it for 3 years twice a week, with no replacements). I've had the yellow bird for 4 months, and i have NO complaints. It has reduced my drying time in half, i LOVE the four different heat settings (cold setting at the end for shine), and (most importantly) the comb is nice and strong! I purchased it at a beauty supply store but i just HAD to come on here and sing this bird's praises! I AM SUCH A FAN!<br /><br />3/23/10-----I STILLL LOOOOOOOVE THE YELLOW BIRD! i use it once a week for my hair and it's still going strong. No problems whatsoever! i've recommended this dryer to about 5 others, they've all bought it and they LOVE it also.<br /><br />3/5/13 -----My YellowBird is still going strong. I use it less on my hair (1-2 times a month), but it's still effective. The ONLY complaint is that I can't order a replacement comb - I dropped the whole unit by mistake and 2 teeth came off on one end. I STILL use the comb, I just divide my hair in smaller sections so that my hair doesn't pass through the end with the broken teeth.|pos
I bought this for my wife just before a trip to Greece.  It worked flawlessly both here and there.  She combined it with a universal plug system from AAA and found no flaws on either in the US or in Europe.|pos
My first expensive hair dryer. It really does dry faster, leaves my hair in better shape, and is amazingly quiet.|pos
The hairdryer fits exactly on the wall-mount that we installed for our Sears hair-dryer.  This hair-dryer has more watts, so more power.  My hair gets dryer much quicker.  A very good product and can't beat the price.  I was searching this product and this price was the cheapest.|pos
I was give my first Jerson First Class hair dryer over 10 years ago.  As soon as I realized it didn't have much life left, I purchased another.  This one is working just as well and perhaps it will also last 10 years.  As long as the company makes this model, that is the only brand I will ever buy.|pos
This is my second 209R.  When my first one finally expired after around five years of daily use, I knew that I wanted another just like it.    This dryer is wondefully efficient, lightweight and has the cord-keeper feature that makes it very easy to store.    Very highly recommended.|pos
good product, very easy to install. Don't use the screw provided instead by special drywall screws otherwise we are very happy with this product.|pos
Good price...It doesn't get too hot to damage your hair...Super fast drying capacity...<br />I didn't know changing the hair dryer makes your life this much easier.|pos
I tried this hair dryer at a hotel and loved the fact that it was lightweight yet powerful.  I have problems with my arms and this allowed me to dry my hair without the added weight of those other hair dryers.  I loved it so much, I bought 2!|pos
The dryer was exactly as advertised and I am extremely satisfied with the hair dryer  It was shipped without delay.|pos
I have thick hair and it dries it in a fraction of the time of other dryers.  Heavy but doesn't bother me esp. since I don't have to hold it as long as others.|pos
I purchased this hair dryer for $200 with the T3 volumizing lotion and Orlando Pita styling brush.  I have never been so disappointed in a salon quality hair dryer.  I am a blow-dry addict who watches my stylist closely when he blows my hair dry.  I am very good at getting a salon quality blow-out at home.  I used this product for 4 months, and it is sitting in the back of a drawer now.  If I wasn't so busy, I would send it back and demand a full refund.  I feel like I was duped.  The strength of the dryer is poor, which results in dry fly-aways.  It also does not get hot enough, so after you have spent 30 minutes blowing your hair dry, it looks like it is still damp and has been blown out with a super market dryer.  I have used the babyliss and solano hair dryers in the past, and am going back to them.  Don't fall for the hype - this company may have a great publicist, but the product falls short.|neg
I love this dryer! It is fast and relatively quiet. I have had great hair days ever since I bought this. Since my hair dryers only seem to last a year or so, I am buying a couple extras as backup. I think this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned.|pos
Under no circumstances should a hair blowdryer have a heat setting hot enough to singe your hair OFF. I now have sections of hair that have been burned off. Also, when I put my hair in a ponytail, I have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off. I also got 2 third degree burns on my skin.     I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok). That's when I noticed my hair has been singed off. With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     The hottest setting on the Evolution is the one that singed my hair off. The medium setting, isn't quite hot enough to get my hair straight. So, back this one is going too.     For what it's worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer and she bought the Evolution, AND the Featherweight, AND the travel one. She is made of money though and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head it is worthless. Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain. I'm going for the Da Vinci model by Elchim this time. All the best salons use Elchim. It's funny that $130 seems like a deal for a blowdryer now.     I purchased mine at Sephora. So, this review is nothing against Amazon. Just want to get the word out there about this product.|neg
WOW! I searched and searched for a good blow dryer and decided upon this one. It was the best decision. I am a professional so I have to have a sturdy blow dryer and this one is that and more! It dries the hair in about 3-4 minutes including long hair! With no frizz! I love it and would buy another one in a heartbeat!|pos
This dryer works as well as everyone said it does. [...]. Definately a difference in the speed of drying your hair and how it looks afterwards. It is quiet and also a bit heavier to hold than other dryers I have used. The price I paid getting it on Amazon was at least $30 cheaper than what I saw it selling for in the stores. It is worth it...you won't be disappointed.|pos
I picked up this dryer when I was staying some nights at my fiancee's apartment, so I could stash it out of his way when I wasn't there. It folds in half and the cord retracts into the handle, making it very small. I was immediately impressed with the power, I have pretty thick hair but I could completely dry it in just a few minutes. When we got married and bought a house it has stayed on with me, becoming my primary hair dryer. I have used it daily for about 3 years now and it has not faltered, definitely worth it!|pos
I have the silver version of this exact blowdryer- i had it for about a year and always used an attachment on the end of it. then all of the sudden the attachment wasn't fitting right and so i used it for about a month without it. I have always noticed how hot the dryer got but didn't think anything of it. I was blowdrying my hair with a round brush and suddenly smelt burning hair. Much to my surprise, it had burnt that chunk of my hair completely off and i now have a patch of very short, miscolored, burnt hair on my head. HORRIBLE product. I looked at the attachment also and the plastic on the inside is completely melted from it getting too hot. No wonder it wasn't fitting anymore.|neg
I bought this hairdryer to use while vacationing in Europe.  It worked great!  It is true that you can only use the low setting in Europe; however, it seemed as though the low setting was  putting out as much air as the high setting usually does here in the US.  Also, I only took a small carry-on suitcase to Europe.  Because of the fold-down capability, this hairdryer fit perfectly into my carry-on.  I would highly recommend this product!|pos
Don't waste another minute of your life looking at this piece of junk.  I am VERY disappointed.      First, the wall-mount...these screw anchors are the largest I've used on such a small device.  My last mounted hair dry used pilot holes almost half the size.  My son's book shelves used smaller holes than these things!  Then, once you get these beasts into the wall, the unit mounts onto the mounting plate with a single turn screw.  So the white plastic unit still wiggles every time you use the hair dryer!     Second, this thing only runs for 15 seconds before overheating (yes, I timed it)!  Sure, you could turn it down so the heating coils are off, and the fan still in high, but what's the point?    My wife, with shoulder length hair, refuses to use it because it turns off so quickly.  Do your self a favor and look somewhere else!|neg
We had these in our old home and left them so as not to disturb the wallpaper.  We were so happy to find them again and they discounted $10 for buying two. That's so great. It is awesome not to have to look for your hairdryer and put it away each time!|pos
I love the blowdryer, the only thing is the color was not what you see in the picture, it was a shade of a greenish gold color. other than that it's great.|pos
this hair dryer does wonders on naturally wavy, thick hair.  it does reduce frizz and makes it very soft and smooth.  the three heat settings are amazing too :)  and i can't even say how much i love the retractable cord feature... no more trying to make my cord wrap around my dryer to keep it out of the way.  great product.|pos
Just prefect for hair drying. Dry me hair within 10 sec, and my wife's in 2 mins.<br />Hair feel even softer after.|pos
Can't believe I was able to get it for such a great price.  This is my 2nd T3 dryer.  This one is so much lighter.  Love it..|pos
I had recently been on vacation, and the hotel had this hair dryer in their bathrooms.  I liked it so much I decided I wanted one for my bathroom, found it, and purchased it!  I have no regrets.<br /><br />First of all I love the convenience of having it mounted within easy reach.  I am always running late, so being able to grab and dry is wonderful.  It is a powerful little dryer and dries my hair quickly.<br /><br />I know others complain about the nightlight... in the beginning it seemed bright so I would simply pull the bathroom door to.  Now I don't even notice it!<br /><br />If you're looking for something efficient, practical and convenient, this is the little dryer for you!|pos
We bought one which lasted 3-1/2 years of fairly tough use from various family members.  Loved the wall mount design, as well as the light weight of the dryer - if you have children or seniors who have difficulty holding heavy dryers for any length of time - this is one of the lightest weight units we found. For the price, (We paid about $14.00 for it at the time - so averages out to about $3+ per year!)we were very pleased with the longevity and the features of the unit, and are buying a new one as a replacement. [[ASIN:B0008ENT8I Jerdon 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]|pos
Mounting was very easy. The hairdryer looks sleek & modern, works efficiently. I'm very happy with it.|pos
I tried this in a recent hotel stay and had to order one for myself at home.  The dryer has a retractable cord which is nice and it drys your hair quickly and without frizz.|pos
This is light weight, inexpensive, and was a great improvement from the travel hairdryer that finally broke after 10 years of use.  I could definitely feel the soft and smoothing effects of the tourmaline.  In fact I loved it so much that I bought another one when I was able to find it at Target for $13.  Plus it's soft material does not scrap your walls or furniture when they rub against each other.    Highly recommend it!|pos
great product|pos
I've had this dryer for about 8 months and use it almost every day. I absolutely love it. I too found it difficult to get my shoulder length hair dry in a reasonable amount of time. I found the trick is to dry my hair with a blow dryer till just damp, roll it in my velcro rollers, then use the bonnet dryer while putting on my make-up (about 10 minutes). I put the hose away while it's still warm so it scrunches up easily and fits back in the unit. I wait just a minute or two til my hair cools then pull the rollers out and style. Hold nice volume all day long. I've never had it overheat or turn off on me (knock on wood). I'll by another one when this one dies!|pos
The day I started using this hairdryer, I got compliments on how good my hair looked - no joke!  People asked me if I'd gotten a haircut and I had to tell them no, just a new hairdryer.  It's a powerful machine for how small and compact it is.  It folds up nicely to fit easily in a gym bag, suitcase or small bathroom drawer.  The cord doesn't retract, which is good in my opinion - my last hairdryer almost started a fire when the retracting cord frayed and sparked.  I'll update if anything goes wrong with this dryer, but I've been using for about 2 months now with no problems.  Highly recommend it for the price, value and functionality!|pos
After years of buying those low cost hairdryers that I knew were not helping my thick curly already dry hair, like another reviewer I started researching for the best one I could find and I knew it would be expensive.  Well, this one is absolutely worth every penny.  My hairstylist was using this dryer and it took 1/2 the time to dry my hair.  I love the extra long cord and the various settings.  It was a little heavy at first, compared to my old Vidal Sassoon but I quickly got used to it.  You will not be disappointed.  I'd purchase another one in a heartbeat.|pos
I suppose some people are never satisfied. I read all of the reviews and was amazed at the detail some wrote. For the price and good quality of this hair dryer I continually am amazed at some of the comments. It drys hair better, it doesn't, it's heavy, it's light WTF? The dryer works as well as any my family have had in the last 30 years. It drys hair--That's it. If you want to spend hundreds well, be my guest. As usual, fast delivery, good price and free shipping in certain cases and always a pleasure to shop on Amazon. Buy it--you'll like it! or don't ?? dang!|pos
The hair drier is as it was described, the price was really good and my daughter and her long hair are very pleased with the drier.<br /><br />The United States Parcel Post took 22 days to deliver it.  It would be worth spending an extra bit of change to get a faster delivery.|pos
Taking into account that this is a travel hair dryer, I have no complaints. It's been used for 5 to 10 minutes every other day for the past couple months and so far not a problem at all. There is only one tiny design complaint I have, and that is I figured the retractable cord would be completely hidden when fully retracted but theres a stopper which allows a good 10 inches of chord to remain...I wouldve preferred it to retract completely to the plug, but fine. I expected something different and this is what I got, so four and a half stars. Otherwise, so far a great product for the unbeatable price. For its size it dries fairly quickly, and does indeed fold up into a nice little package (however you'll end up winding the rest of the chord around it anyway). And the folding handle makes a fair amount of cracking noise when you fold it...not the smoothest mechanism, but fine. Once again, not perfect, but for size it's as good as it gets.<br />UPDATE: It's now been a good 12 months or so, and the usage has gone up to 5-10 minutes almost every day. It's fallen off the counter 3 to 4 times, and still works like a charm. The other day (now about 6 months ago) however, the button to retract the cord flew off (with spring) while the cord was furiously being pulled out. I tried to reattach but it lost its retracting mechanism. Fine, now it's a regular drier. Although I do have to admit it's definitely very powerful for its size, quite amazing actually. Still works like a charm.|pos
My daughter was getting scared of the hair dryer so we tried this one and she loves.  In addition it's probably the best hair dryer we've owned in recent memory and my wife wants one too now.|pos
This is one of the best hair dryers I've ever had... I recommend it 100%, and it's worth every penny!!!|pos
I am returning this hairdryer -- that is, if they'll let me; I still haven't received a reply to my request and it's been a week. I tried it once and found it had a high-pitched loud whine which my other quiet hairdryer fortunately did not have (Sassoon; discontinued). Also, the cords were too short and the light is way too bright.|neg
At this point, most hair dryers are fairly equal in their ability to dry hair.  So, I was looking for a model that would be quiet and hopefully not expose my ears to as much damage as the regular hair dryer. This model highlighted being quiet as a feature.  Totally untrue. It was significantly noisier than my old Conair dryer which cost the same.  I will not trust Revlon again.  Buy it only if you want dry hair and limited hearing.|neg
Years ago I got a remington hair dryer similar to this one and through the years and many moves it got lost.  I had been looking for one a long time and I found it at Amazon.com.  I am very pleased with this item.  I would recommend the product and your service to anyone.|pos
I was very close to purchasing one of those T3 hairdryers but didn't want to take my chances after reading that Amazon was perhaps an unauthorized seller of that product. I went ahead and decided on the FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 and I can honestly say that it was worth every penny. I was initially skeptical on its claims that it cuts drying time in half and maintains moisture but its true. I have type 3C hair - which is kinky yet delicate - and it straightened my hair like a dream. Not to mention that the motor is half as quiet as the any cheap drug store dryer. I would highly recommend The FHI Heat Nano Salon Pro 2000 to anyone wanting a quality hair dryer. It's worth the investment|pos
Its light weight and I love the new technology.  It's very good for colored treated hair.|pos
Amazingly quick-drying for such a small appliance.  Takes up such little space.  I love, love, love this hair dryer!|pos
I wish I had read further down the reviews before I bought this myself. I read the first few reviews at the time & everyone seemed to love it. Indeed, I loved it when I first got it, so much so that I bought a second one to have should this one burn out (that happened to me once on vacation!!).  Over time, I noticed my hair was becoming brittle and coarse and was thinning out.  I attributed it to a new medication I was taking.  My curly hair actually turned straight because of this medication and now I assumed my hair was continuing to morph into brittleness and falling out due to the meds. I also noticed that whenever my hair dresser cuts & blows out my hair, I have soft normal hair.  I thought it was her hair products that gave that result.  While ordering this as a gift for someone recently, I noticed the many negative reviews which described exactly what had happened to MY hair too! I bought a new different brand of hair dryer and my hair has now been restored to normal, soft shiny hair just like when my hair dresser does it.  While mine has never burned out or sparked, it does shoot out smoke now and then, but not often.  Stay away from this blow dryer.  It will ruin your hair.|neg
I was looking for a wall mount hair dryer and came up with the Andis read the reviews and decided that this dryer was for me in the 2nd bathroom so the night light helps and is not in anyway visable until you get into the hallway. great hair dryer would highly recomend this one!!!!!!!!!!!|pos
When I first purchased this product in March of 2009 I loved it.  Less than 90 days later the item made a popping sound and now only works on the high setting.   There are several similar comments about this product only working for a short period of time, or the product starting to spark.  Buyer beware.   This item is probably not safe.|neg
I have always felt that Conair makes the best dryers.  It is quiet and drys your hair quickly.  Nice black color.  Lightweight.|pos
We used a hairdryer like this in a hotel.  It was so powerful that we came home and ordered one.  We love it.  It cuts the drying time in half.  It folds for traveling and has a retractable cord.  We love it!|pos
I was impressed the first time I used this hairdryer. It cut my drying time in at least half. And it was alot smoother.|pos
You will notice the quality of this product as soon as its out of the package.  The plastic is thick and has some give to it, not like that cheap stuff that is hard and brittle.  The motor is very tolerable.  I would say it is quieter than most I've used.  I like the three speeds as well as the three temps.  That is so much better than just having one temp and a slower speed.  It still has a cold shot to freeze your hair when you've got it where you want it.  Great product!|pos
This is the second Conair 204P hair dryer that I've owned, and it is truly the best hair dryer I've seen.  It is small, yet powerful.  In addition, it is quiet!  I am so glad to have found it, as it came out in stores a number of years ago.  I feel especially pleased that a portion of my purchase goes to Breast Cancer Awareness.  Thank you, Amazon.|pos
I purchased this hairdrier after reading the reviews from Consumer Reports - rated in the top 2.  I tried to find locally, but couldn't find any from this manufacturer...but was tired of NOISY, HEAVY hairdriers!  This one works great, has multiple temperature settings and is quiet and light - with an extra long cord to boot.  It is also very attractively styled.  No regrets.|pos
I bought this hair dryer to replace an old Conair 1875 watt one.  The old one was at least 12yrs. old and was still working, but making strange noises so I decided to look for its replacement before it died at an inopportune time!  This dryer is great.  It has a lot more 'wind' power than the old one did but it does not seem to get as hot, which with the power is not an issue...it does not burn my head if I stay in one place too long as the old one did.  The case is easy to hold, the dual controls are different, but better than the one it replaced.  I would recommend this hair dryer without any negative issues.  I did not want to spend a lot of money for an ion dryer and this one is perfect.  It leaves my hair much softer and manageable and does a good job of drying hair fast.  The Amazon statement did not mention 'ion'...but on the box it states it is an 'ion' dryer.|pos
My Yellowbird has finally passed, after about 5 years of blowing out the hair of my family and friends. I am an African American female, and this blowdryer has straightened out some of the toughest hair imaginable! I braid the hair of my family and friends, and this dryer has been well-used on a weekly basis since I took it out of the package. I used it up until it died on me today!!! I am soooo glad that Amazon sells it, b/c I am about to purchase a new one right now!|pos
I bought 5 of these (with nightlight) to put in each bathroom of my home.  I find the light is a useful addition and can be turned off by clicking the test button on the power cord.  The dryer is powerful, not extremely noisy, and appears to be of good quality contruction.|pos
The Remington D-2012 is a solid, reliable hair dryer.  The controls are easy to access and use.  The hot is really hot and the cool is really cool.  There is a noticeable difference between the heat levels and between the intensity levels.  It's a good size, and not too heavy.  It's easy to clean.  The attachments fit well.<br /><br />My only quibbles are that the finish shows every single fingerprint, and there are plenty after you've added your mousse or styling gel.  And I would love a retractable cord.  Try as I might, I can never wind up the cord into a tidy compact mass.|pos
I just used my dryer last night and I'm in love. My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week so I did my research and saw the great review on this product and they were right, it's great!    The dryer is a bit heavier than the old one, but after a few minutes you realize the heaviness relates to the quality. It almost gives it a little bit of leverage when you use it.     The airflow is salon quality. My hair dried faster, looked shinier and felt extremely soft. It doesn't feel over dried or brittle as it usually did with my old dryer. I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can't wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.    The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG plus, no more tangles and messy cords taking up my bathroom space (now if only they could do that with my curling iron ;)    Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price.|pos
Well worth the money.  We always bought inexpensive hair dryers, but now can see the difference a professional model can make.  Would buy again.|pos
I LOVE this blow dryer. Several years ago my old professional blow dryer died, and I ended up replacing it with the best that Walmart could provide. It seemed to have all the latest and greatest technology and bells and whistles (3 heat settings, cool button, 3 air speeds with ion, ceramic heat), but my hair just wasn't getting dry. By the time my hair dried my scalp was soaked, and my hair was was still frizzy no matter how much anti-frizz hair product I used. I have what a hair professional termed textured hair. It's thick, porous, dries slowly because it retains moisture, and tends to frizz.     This blow dryer dries my hair fast, straight, and my hair feels great. It takes half the time to actually get my hair dry now, and my scalp isn't soaked afterwards. This blow dryer gives me the same results as my salon visits. Big revelation....not all blow dryers are alike.    This blow dryer is an investment, but thanks to the great reviews I was confident in giving it a try, and I'm so glad I did. It's worth every penny in time savings, and I like my hair again, and I actually have a hair style.|pos
Hair dyer works great for it's size. It doesnt over heat like some customers say it does. Works great for condisioning and dying hair. Only drawback I see is it's hard getting everything back into the case|pos
First used this hair dryer in a hotel room. Liked it so much, when I came home, I ordered two. One for me and one for my daughter.  It is so powerful, it dries my hair VERY fast. More than twice as fast as my previous hair dryer.!|pos
Only one advise: Avoid buying this horrible product!<br />I own several Andis pet clipper products so I trusted the brand. I was wrong!<br />I don't think Andis manufactured this product. It's just a generic, low quality dryer disguised as an Andis.|neg
I've been very pleased with this hairdryer. I read the reviews here before buying it -- but don't find that it's heavy like some have stated.  I love that it has a warm setting (not just hot and cold)|pos
over the years of working in salons, my own included, i have had many dryers. i like working with this as it is extremely light weight and dries the hair very fast and almost frizz free. excellant product for the professional stylist|pos
Definitely a great dryer. Nice and lightweight yet very powerful with various heat settings. Most professional hair dryers are large and very heavy so your arm tires while drying your hair but this one is smaller and easier on the arm. Would recommend.|pos
While only moderately useful for drying my short hair, I loaned this to my fiance to check it out and she said it was great! She used to have a very expensive hair dryer and said that this one worked just as well. Of course, everyone's hair is different but the important thing is that the temperature is good and with the optional diffuser attachment, there are more options depending on your hair style. Male or Female, this is a great product at a good price and the quality seems very good at this price point as well.|pos
This Remington hair dryer really is a terrific hair dryer. I've been using it for about a month now and my hair has never looked better. It has three heat settings and two speeds. I use the lowest speed unless I'm in a big hurry.  I do the same with the heat settings because all of them are great for drying my hair.  It is a heavy hair dryer, but that does not matter to me. I never dreamed it would work this well.  After drying my hair and then using the flat iron, my hair is frizz free and shiny. I love it!|pos
We've been using this hair dryer for a few weeks now on a constant basis.  Overall, this is a powerful blower that gets your hair dry quickly with excellent balance of heat.  No hot spots that cheapo dryers can develop.  Yes, it is on the heavy and bulky side but that's because of the quality construction.  I have no doubt this dryer will continue to last for years to come.|pos
to cut down the drying time. Even when it's on cool my hair dries fast. I wish I would had gotten the ceramic one|pos
Excellent product, compact and powerful with ion generator and cool green nightlight (LED). Nice design , Built in Ground fault protection and thoughtful cord hook. Very easy to mount and fairly quiet in operation, especially on low speed.|pos
My wife (who doesn't speak / write English by the way, hense not writing this herself) especially likes the attachments and overall quality of this dryer, the three heat settings which provide just the right range, as well as the no heat / blow only setting.<br /><br />But she says the blower is far too strong and wonders why it doesn't provide a lower setting than hurricane strength.  I can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire.<br /><br />I imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer's head and that's why it's so hot and blows so strong, but of course someone using it on themselves doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Ceramic is nice, as well as the ion emissions.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Despite complaining about the strength of the fan, she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item.  I imagine she'll get used to the fan strength.|pos
I purchased this hair dryer and when I plugged it in for the first time, it knocked my outlet surge protector and also the circuit breaker for the bathroom! I had not even turned the hair dryer on! It had the hot, electric smell. I sent it back for a refund which Amazon quickly honored. I will not try this brand again.|neg
This is my new favorite hair dryer.  It has numerous settings so I can get the heat and air flow that I want for various sections of my hair.  The balance is good and it is not too heavy, which tends to be a problem with other hair dryers with this excellent level of air flow volume. I wish it had a retractable cord, but that would add bulk that I would probably be unhappy with!|pos
I am very happy with the Remington D-2012 hair dryer. The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.|pos
I've ordered lots of things on Amazon before, but this is the first time I feel compelled to write a review. I just love this hair dryer! I bought it because I was tired of all the different cords on our bathroom counter- hair dryer, straightener, curler, husband's shaver charger, etc. So the retractable feature was what drew me to this product. But after using it, I've found a bunch of added bonus, one of which is how fast it dries my hair. It literally takes only half the time than my previous drier. It's also pretty quiet, and the ceramic coil doesn't produce the burning smell like older hair driers do. Overall I'd say this is the one product that really impressed me. [...]|pos
I bought this product too, to get it at a lower price. But honestly, its not worth it because it broke within 3 months. The serial number on the product was not legit (should be a silver label), so chances are the products shipped from Amazon are not real t3 hairdryers. Also considering the fact that Amazon is not a licensed distributor, you should avoid buying it because the warranty is not covered by the manufacturer. If you want to invest in this hair dryer try to find it at a local beauty store (I found one with warranty and all for $170) and be sure to look for the silver serial number label!|neg
Andis 30130 Hangup 1600W wall Mount Hair Dryer-Excellent value for the price...telephone style cord is great!|pos
The hair dryer is lightweight but powerful, easy to handle, and versatile in its variety of heat and fan settings. I found the large attachment for spreading the heat over the entire head especially helpful for when I wanted to dry the hair without blowing it. Blow-drying also worked well, with ample heat to get the job done. The instant cool button would be helpful to a professional, but the heat-adjustment switch is sufficient for me, a casual user. The motor is pleasantly quiet.<br /><br />The only slight quibble I have with it is that the safety feature built into the power cord makes for an extra layer of on-off; and until I learned which button was on and which was emergency off I found myself fumbling around for half a minute before I could actually turn the dryer on. (It's not intuitively obvious whether a red button should mean hot, and therefore on, or whether it is red as for a panic button to turn the device off; or whether the reset button is to reset the unit to on or to reset it to off.)|pos
I had read the review in In style and my prior Conair hair dryer had died.  It works great and I love the retractable cord.|pos
I have no complaints about this hairdryer.  It is quieter than any other dryer I have used and dries my hair quickly on the medium heat setting.  It comes with two attachments, one for curly and one for a more direct flow of air.  It's light and is easy to hold and manipulate.  Highly recommended!|pos
Quick delivery. Used dryer in great shape. The Mrs. is hard to please when it comes to hair care products. Another great product from conair and another safe and enjoyable transaction with the big A Way to go Amazon|pos
I love the way this dryer works.  It's not so powerful that it blows the hair all over the place but it's ionic feature makes my hair feel so much thicker and I love the nightlight, too!|pos
1. I was very happy with the smaller size and lighter weight of this dryer. It doesn't get heavy while using.<br />2. I really appreciate the easy reach of the temperature buttons, cool shot and on and off buttons.<br />3. It also dries hair more quickly than other dryers.<br />4. It has a nice look to it.<br />5. Lastly, this dryer is easy on the hair too.It leaves hair feeling soft and looking glossy.<br />I love it and recommend it highly.|pos
I bought this exact drier from walmart yesterday it was 50% off...and i couldnt wait to use and when i did i loved it...i can talk to my fiancee and still hear him while using it do to the reduced noise...the only thing is that it takes longer to dry hair than most dryers but so what PLAN AHEAD and MAKE TIME for your hair!!!!|pos
This wall mounted unit was easy to install, has plenty of power and eliminates all the bother of storage and cord untangling of a portable unit. The automatic shutoff feature works great. The unit has 2 speeds, however the high speed is normally used.|pos
This dryer is even better than the one my stylist uses, he's SO jealous!  Takes me half as long to dry my long thick hair now, and it's not as frizzy either.  GREAT dryer!  OH, and it's SO quiet too, I don't have to worry about waking anyone in the next room when I do my hair.|pos
We purchased this unit after seeing it previewed on a shopping channel and hearing how professional stylists in Hollywood and elsewhere use it with great effectivness. Our experience is the same. On the low heat setting the temperature is consistent and the unit is much quieter than any other brand we've tried before. It has a nice long cord and comes with a supply of air filters. I have been able to eliminate hairspray as I style the hair with the dryer and a comb. There must be something special in the tourmaline technology and ions because my hair looks great. I recommend this product to anyone looking for a new hair dryer. It costs more than most dryers but the product quality, the quietness on the low setting, the long cord, the most important item, the way my hair looks makes the price worth it.|pos
I purchased this one after keeping an eye out for a compact wall-mounted unit for our small guest bathroom.  It fits in a tight space quite nicely.  Does all the things that a hair dryer is supposed to do.  Reasonably quiet and robust drying air flow.  A good purchase at a very reasonable price.  Would recommend for anybody looking for this type hair dryer.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X2UCJO Jerdon First Class Wall Mount Hair Dryer, 1600 watts, 2 Speeds/Heat Settings, White]]|pos
The Remington D-2012 is definitely a grade above the $10-$30 hair dryers you see at Target.  Whether or not it is comparable to a CHI, I don't know.  I DO know it is half the price of a CHI, and unlike Farouk (who makes the CHI), Remington will honor the warranty if you buy it on the internet.  The CHI is a solid product so not many people get bitten by the voided warranty when you buy on Amazon, but there's always that chance.<br /><br />The D-2012 has two air speeds and three heat settings.  I use middle heat + low airflow for my short guy hair.  My wife uses high heat + low or high airflow for her long thick hair.  She says it drys so fast that her hair is dry before she has finished styling it.<br /><br />The dryer has a very solid, commercial grade feel to it.  Read this to mean it's heavy compared with basic hair dryers.  I find it to be quieter than my wife's old dryer that claimed to be quiet.<br /><br />All in all this product is a winner if you are looking for a really good solid hair dryer but you don't have the coin for a CHI.  This hair dryer is likely one of the best in the sub $50 category.|pos
Great service, shipped and arrived on time. Have used the product before and am satisfied with it.|pos
I am very pleased with this product.  I like it even more than the others I have used in many hotels rooms--it's quiet but dries my hair really well. I like the nightlight but I unplug it during the day since it isn't sensitive to light/dark.|pos
fantastic product. I feel like I'm in a hotel when I shower. The price was incredible also.|pos
This little hair dryer is fantastic for the price!  It's speedy and I love the fact it hangs up.  The black is priced much less than the white.  Super Bargain!|pos
This is a great product and the price half of what you would pay at a salon.|pos
Good, handy little hair dryer that I can keep in a drawer at the bathroom sink.  I'm a head shaver so I only needed this for my son (occasionally) and for guests.  Works great.|pos
I have mid-back length thick blonde hair which typically has the consistancy of cotton candy after I use a hair dryer...sticky and frizzy. After using the t3, this is no longer a problem.  The next morning when I ran my brush through it, it didn't so much as snag.   As for the warranty issue, it should come as no surprise...almost every negative review is because of this. I would rather chance $100 without a warranty than pay $200 more for one.  If my hair dryer blows up, I can buy a new one and still have spent less money.|pos
[[ASIN:B0009XH6V4 Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer]]My 10 year old granddaughter never used a hair dryer until she received this one from me as a gift. Now she uses her dryer every night. I wanted her to have a small but powerful dryer, and it is. I will be ordering one for myself today.|pos
I bought this to replace one just like it , I have used it everyday for at least 5years, I love the way it is out of the way , and right at your finger tips.|pos
The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo is easy to use, moves a lot of air, and packs just as easily as a folding travel hair dryer. It's extremely well constructed and in comparison to my previous folding travel hair dryer, the quality of everything from the breaker plug to switch in the handle, far exceeds my previous unit. Could be used as a everyday hair dryer and takes up very little space.|pos
I was very disappointed with this dryer.  It essentially was a hand-held dryer with a hanger.  The hanger was completely independent of the dryer.  I thought the hanger would have a plug, but no, the dryer had the plug and a very long cord.  I thought the hanger would turn the dryer off when the dryer was placed in the hanger--no, you just turned the dryer off as you would any hand held.  Save your money and buy a hook to hang your dryer on.|neg
My favorite blow-dryer! Dries your hair fast (on Turbo setting) with minimal damage.     NOTE: For those with wavy hair, it tended to straighten out my curls a bit, but didn't get rid of frizz so much.|pos
This is the second time I have bought this dryer. My housekeeper accidently broke the little latch on the first one so it wouldn't atay hung up anymore. I had the first one for about 3 or 4 years & I loved it enough to repurchase rather than getting another brand or style. Highly recommend this dryer for its convenience and quick hair drying!|pos
This ion shine hair dryer is great, especially for my hair, which is very fine. The wattage is great for fine hair and it has high/low and warm/hot settings. It also has the cool shot button which I love. The ion technology is really nice, I have noticed that my hair is very soft after using it and my split ends are practically non-existent. The buttons do take some getting used to but totally worth it!!|pos
I had this hair dryer for years until the surge protector button on the plug kept popping out. I bought a Conair hair dryer at Wal Mart to replace it, got home, plugged it in, and couldn't believe how cheap and loud it sounded. I returned it immediately, and was happy to find that the Remington was available from Amazon.com.   I'm completely sold on this hair dryer. The motor is quiet and drying time is short. The only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first. But after using it a few times, I suppose I got used to it because now that's not an issue.|pos
This product was just bad.  After I rolled my hair, it was hard to put the cap on my head.  The strings were supposed to tighten, but that was easier said than done.  The cap never got tight as i wanted it.  So this product was just bad.|neg
This dryer ruined my hair!!! At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair. After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn't know what it was. (It didn't smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won't curl, and is breaking all over.  Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn't matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I'm getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I'm extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product.|neg
Love, Love, Love this hairdryer.  It delivers what it promises and the fact that you push a button and the cord retracts INSIDE the handle is a definite plus for neat storage!|pos
My teenaged daughter kept borrowing my blow dryer until i finally purchased another (of the same) for her.  I love how quiet this blow dryer is and how quickly it dries my hair. My daughter has long, thick hair and it dries hers quickly as well.  It is light in weight and the airflow is controlled. I use mine daily and have not have any problems in the 18 months since i purchased it.|pos
My purchase arrived just a couple of days later!  I had expected longer delivery time.  The T3 was priced much lower than other web sites.  It is light weight and has a little bling on the handle.    Dried quickly and I am thrilled to get the lower price for the exact same product listed elsewhere.  Thanks for quality products at lower price and excellent delivery.  Who says a Grandma can't be cool with a new blinged out T3?|pos
I researched hair dryers prior to making my purchase because this is something I rely on very seriously and need it to work and do a good job.  I was replacing a very cheap and extremely annoying hair dryer I have had as a back up.  I have not been disappointed.  It has a nice feel, is not annoyingly noisy and does a great job.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a quality dryer.|pos
I first discovered this little gem of a hairdryer at our condo. while on vacation near Orlando. I was so impressed, I ordered one when I got home and use it as a spare when I go to the gym. There's a lot of power in this little dryer; two speeds - high and low. I prefer high and my hair (which is fairly long and thick) dries very quickly and seems to wave extra nicely with this dryer. I love it!|pos
Thought it was a little heavy when i first used it. I got used to using it and i don't think that now. It's very easy to use. Has 3 different heat settings. Has a low and a high speed. The cord keeper feature is great, saves a lot of space. I'd recommend this hair dryer.|pos
I thought I could never replace my Baby Bliss Professional; however, this product has taken the lead.|pos
My wife got to try this product out at a friend's house and feel in love with it after 1 use. The price seemed a little steep but after the purchase it was well worth it. It takes her a fraction of the time to blow dry her hair. This thing gets hot fast without heating up the bathroom too much. The massive output of heat really dries her hair quickly and keeps her from being in a hot room and getting sweaty just to dry her hair like the last hair dryer did. I've never seen or heard of a better hair dryer, a definite buy!  *Colors may vary-it seems there is either red on black, or black on black*|pos
HAS EVERITHING I WAS WAITING FOR. IT'S A VALUABLE ITEM. SINCERELY I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT|pos
I bought this dryer being excited about the compact size and the 1875W.  In using it for the last couple of months, the force of air flow has weakened substantially to the point where I need to purchase another dryer. My obvious choice will NOT be this one.  It appears to have a plastic fan which may limit its longevity.  Also, the wide opening on the blower end makes it harder to focus on a particular area making it difficult to control what section of hair is styled and what's not. In the past, the dryers I have purchased lasted at least a couple of years.  This one was a great disappointment!|neg
I have always used relatively inexpensive hair dryers and have never had one break.  I splurged over $150 for a Bespoke Dryer and the thing burned out before I even had it for a year (and I don't even use it once daily).  It literally sets off the smoke alarm when I use it.  Had to throw it out.  What a total waste of money.  And forget any warranty - they don't stand by their product.|neg
My old Conair died so I read all the reviews and decided on this hairdryer.  Very satisfied.  The weight is good, the attachments are fine, and the price was right!  You don't need anything better.  I really like the ability to open the cover to get to the mesh filter to clean it and the 3 heat settings and 3 blower settings. A winner!|pos
If I have this right, this is an older, closeout version of the current $300 Evolution hairdryer but for the price it's a great deal.  It is not the identical model to the current one, as it only has 1600 watts vs. 2000 watts for the current one.  But, look at it this way, you could buy 3 of these for the same price as the one from an authorized dealer with a warranty-and you would still have to pay $15+ to have it fixed if it breaks under the warranty.  The one we got came with no serial number as described in other reviews below, but it has been working extremely well and as advertised in that it dries hair significantly faster than our old Conair Yellowbird 2000 watt and leaves your hair feeling much softer.  I'd rather pay $100 with no warranty than $300 with one (that's like spending $200 on an extended warranty).|pos
We wanted something that our children could use since we have very limited counter space in the bathroom.  So far, it's been just what we needed.  And, it is much more quiet than hotel wall mounts we have used.|pos
For its price, it is a good deal. Dries hair nicely and quickly. The ion feature works - it makes the hair shinier and less frizzy. Overall a good investment to manage your hair.|pos
I love this dryer.  It dries your hair faster as it claims and is light weight for holding.  So far so good.|pos
I've been using an Andis ProStyle 1600 hair dryer for 10 or more years.  For me it is perfect.  The most important feature for me is that I can drop the heat 1 setting and still keep the fan on high.  It is light weight, blows lots of air, and is inexpensive.  Mine is still going strong, but I'm buying a backup to replace it for when it dies, as all hairdryers eventually do.|pos
My wife LOVES this blow dryer so much that she wanted me to buy one for our daughter too! Excellent price for excellent product!|pos
My sister had a hair dryer just like this one and it broke. She had purchased it at Target but it was no longer available. I found it on Amazon and bought it for her. It was just what she was looking for!|pos
I used it once a day for the last four months and now it sounds like an airplane engine with hardly any air flowing out....stay away from conair!!|neg
I bought it because of the good reviews and it's quietness. It's not as powerful as the others I've had, but it does dry my hair quicker with less frizz. I'm happy with it and so are my kids because it's quieter than my previous one.|pos
This dryer works great! It provides a nice heat and it even has a lint collector that can be taken off to clean|pos
excellent product - reasonably quiet, size is good and price is super for a product of this quality|pos
I bought this hair dryer with high hopes that it would be the dryer of my dreams!  Not so.  I used it for about a month, trying to like it.  It was quiet and light weight, but didn't dry my hair in half the time of my cheap dryer like everyone states it should.  It took about the same amount of time due to the fact that it doesn't have much blowing power.  It's like my old hair dryer on low!  I hated it so much I sold it on ebay and bought an Elchim 2100.  Now, that dryer really BLOWS!  It's also a whole lot less expensive and supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  At 5 minutes of use per day (yes, it's that fast), that's 65 years!|neg
What a powerful hair dryer!  It's a little heavy, but it blows so hard I can dry my hair in 3-4 minutes, so I don't mind.  Supposed to last for 2000 hours of use.  If that's true, I'll be dead before this hair dryer dies!|pos
DON'T but this hairdryer.  I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking.  It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard.  Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!|neg
I have had four of these wall mounted hair dryers and love them, they are up and out of the way and stay pretty much un-noticable  No fiddling with on off buttons and looking for a place to store it.  If one leaves the on switch ON and hangs it up, it goes off and returns to the blowing setting as soon as one lifts it again. This is great. on a scale of 1-10 This item scores 11.|pos
I love the dryer, although the color is all black, not silver.  Either way, it gives a silky smooth blow dry.|pos
This dryer exceeds expectations.  Dries hair fast, is quiet and light weight (big plus) and no frizzies!  In fact, sometimes it makes my hair too silky so I have to use more harsh shampoo or only a teenie weenie bit of conditioner.|pos
I purchased this for my sister, who has long, naturally curly and somewhat frizzy hair.  She also has cerebral palsy so needed a dryer that was lightweight.  This one fit the bill; she loved it on the first use.  Her hair was smooth & shiny and the dryer works great.  A great value!|pos
I've been using this dryer for about a month now.  Although the wattage is less than my old hair dryer it dries my hair much quicker.  My hair looks smoother and I barely need to use my flat iron anymore.  On/off switch is right where my hand goes when I hold it with my left hand which is annoying, but other than that I think it is great.|pos
I was very angry to hear that the T3 dryer I purchased is not covered under warranty because I purchased it through amazon. T3 charges $14.95 to repair but wanted to charge me $54.95 because I purchased from amazon. Do not purchase if you care about the warranty, and you may need it as my dryer stopped working about 16 months.|neg
I agree with the first review, I bought the same dryer and it only lasted for eight weeks.  It began fizzing and spewing sparks - very scary for a hair dryer.    Do not waste your money on this brand - it's very low quality and not worth the investment.|neg
Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful.  I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn't have fingers; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers) I've used.  It left my curly hair curly without frizz like some older hair dryers.  The only drawback I can see is it's quite large so when traveling I will have to resort to my old fold-up one.|pos
Before I make a purchase I generally like to read the reviews, but I do take them with grain of salt. Everyone has their own opinion, and let's face it we're not all going to agree. I actually have never felt so strongly about a product that I felt the need to write a review. That is until now. I can't stress enough how disappointed I am in this dryer. I work hard for my money so I thought long and hard before forking out $[...] for a dryer 11 months ago. When it first arrived I loved it. It did what it said it would, it dried my hair faster, it was quiet and lightweight. My friends made fun of me for spending so much, but I have thick hair and I thought of it as an investment. I purchased it on February 8, 2008. Today is January 27, 2009 and my dryer is BROKEN. It overheats and sparks. This dryer had normal use (5 or 6x/week). [...].     As if I'm going to give them any more of my hard earned money. No thank you Bespoke labs. I will say that investing in a good dryer is worth it. Ask any hair stylist. My friend bought a Chi for about the same money, (maybe less) I tried it, and frankly I preferred it. It dried my hair even faster than the T3. For those of you who have and enjoy your T3s, I understand, I did too for 11 months. For those of you considering buying one, I would STRONGLY discourage it.|neg
It is very handy, does a good job drying my hair. I liked it so well I bought a second one for the other bathroom.|pos
This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I used to swear by the Chi but this one is not even comparable!  Very happy with it!|pos
If you enjoy the convenience of a wall mounted air dryer when you travel....why not have the same at home ! This mounted unit keeps my sink area uncluttered. It is attractive...works well and out of the way.|pos
Wouldn't pay full retail for it..because I personally can not afford to pay full retail but I believe it's safe to say that this is absolutly one of the best if not THE best hairdryer out there. Very pretty with the jewel studded handle. Powerful,light,quiet and pretty much does everything it claims to do. I can easily see how this can be a favorite of the worlds top stylists. At the price I got it for on Amazon website I am very pleased! You won't be dissappointed with it.|pos
Have not bought a new hair dryer in years and was quite happy with this purchase.|pos
This dryer was very cheap but not cheap made. It works alot better then I expected.Very good buy. I would recommend.|pos
I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.  I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom.|neg
This Andis 30970, was a wonderful purchase.  Good size, good heat temperature, easy to install and the cord hanger goes on either the right or left side.  I have had other wall mounted dryers, they were hard to hang, the Andis was up in a matter of minutes.|pos
Being able to have a blow dryer at hand, rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet, makes the morning routine so much easier.  One tip...to prevent overheating, do occasionally remove the screen from the back of the dryer.  Once the screen has been removed, built up lint can be accessed and cleaned easily.|pos
fast, lightweight and durable.   This is the BEST hair dyer ever.   Not only does my hair dry in half the time it also looks shinny and healthy.   I love this hairdryer!|pos
I bought the Conair Pro Style 1875 dryer about 6 months ago.    I rarely used it, but lately since I've been trying to save money, I've started to do my own hair at home.    That is when I discovered that this dryer was just a waste of space in the top of my closet.    It barely dries my hair, but it will burn a hole in at the top of my scalp! I am constantly moving my head left to right so that the heat can touch every side of my hair all while running my fingers through so the heat can get to the inside of the hair. It's just too much work done on my part!...and that's not the worst part    The dryer is CONSTANTLY COLLAPSING on my head!! Not once, not twice, but all the time I'm under the dryer. So while i'm twisting my head and separating my hair with one hand, i'm holding the bonnet up with the other.    PLEASE DO NO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!|neg
She asked for a colorful hairdryer to take back to Texas A and M. This one has a beautiful glittery finish, while also being a very good one. She rally did like it!|pos
It looks good, light in weight, very powerful, makes my hair shine.  These new tourmaline ceramic dryers are not always what they advertise to be, but this dryer is everything it says it is and more.  It cost a little more, but it is worth every penny.|pos
VERY nice dryer. Larger sized travel. Nice power & doesn't frizz my hair like my old dryer did. Happier with a full-sized travel than the compact ones... dries hair faster & without the frizz!|pos
Don't buy this product! It is NOT from an auth dealer. Amazon put up a fight when I returned it and it somehow it got lost in the mail so they didnt refund me. Seriously don't get sucked in.|neg
I really love this blowdryer.  It really does eliminate frizz.  I'm not sure if my hair really is healthier, but it definitely LOOKS like it is!|pos
On a recent trip one of our hotels had this dryer in the room and my wife liked it so much I ordered one.  Now it's her favorite.|pos
This hair dryer has a large hood so I can use fat curlers.  It is easy to set up and is not as noisy as some dryers I have used.  It is light weight and very stable when set up. It is a great product for the price.|pos
I used this product in a hotel on vacation. I loved it so much, that is why I purchased this one. It is a fabulous hair dryer.|pos
I mainly purchased this hair dryer to bring some order into our bathroom. A bit more expensive than a standard hair dryer (i.e. just a dryer with a cord), but worth it.  The dryer was easy to mount on the wall.  The cord & dryer now stay out of way, and the night light (sufficient to light that way in the middle of the night) is a nice bonus. Of course, the dryer does a good job as well.  I can recommend this product.  Update: 1 year later, works great.  Bought a 2nd one.|pos
A MUST HAVE FOR FREEZY/CURLY /UNRULY HAIR ,MAKES BLOW DRYING A BREEZE,I PURCHASED ONE ABOUT 12 YEARS AGO...STILL GOING STRONG!I USE IT EVERY DAY,ALSO FOR TOUCH UPS, SO I'VE DECIDED TO GET A NEW ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER THAT WILL GRADUATE COLLEGE(JUST IN CASE SHE DECIDES TO MOVE OUT...:)),FAIRLY LIGHT,RIGHT PRICE,AND COMBINED WITH AMAZON SERVICE AND RELIABILITY.........PRICELESS ,GO FOR IT ,YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.|pos
this hair dryer does nothing to your hair but leave it frizzy and not completely dry!!!!  And it constantly cuts off - this started on the second use so the vent could not have been clogged enough to cause this.  Invest in a nicer dryer if you want your hair to look right!!!!  I am definitely going to try to return mine to the store...it really sucks!!!|neg
I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don't like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it's small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn't get sore.<br />Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.<br />Highly recommend this hair dryer!|pos
We've owned one of these before and loved it.  It hangs on the wall in our bathroom so it's always handy.  When the first one broke my wife had to go back to the bulky old one she had until I found this on Amazon. Easiest way to make a wife happy!|pos
I love this blow dryer! The first time I used it I couldn't believe how much volume and thickness I had in my usually limp hair! I rarely have to use a curling iron now because my frizzy ends have disappeared. Definitely worth the investment.|pos
I used a Sunbeam wall-mount dryer for many years. When it died, I looked to find a replacement, but saw that Sunbeam had changed the design a bit. Fearing that they might have ruined the classic model, I bought this one instead because it looked in the picture like the former Sunbeam design.    What a mistake. The Jerdon is clearly a poor knockoff of the original Sunbeam. It's bulkier and heavier. The catches that clip in the handset part don't latch positively like the Sunbeam did. Just about everything about this dryer seems inferior to the Sunbeam.    The only thing that some people might like better is the heat level. This thing is HOT! If you're one who likes to start the day with a singe on your scalp, this is the dryer for you! In fact, the dryer is so hot, it CAUGHT ON FIRE after we owned it less than a year!    So here I am on Amazon again to buy another dryer. But this time, I'll do the right thing and get the 1632 instead!|neg
This is a great hair dryer. I love the retractable cord and the folding handle -- makes it great for travel. The 1875 watts of power dry the wet hair quickly and I don't have any frizz problems. Other hair dryers don't seem to put out as much hot air so I really like this one for the nice blast of heated air. I've not had any problems with the cord and it's lightweight and easy to maneuver.<br />Recommended!|pos
This dryer is perfect for travel.  It is not tiny, like some travel dryers, but is smaller than the normal hair dryer.  The pullout cord is extra long, the handle folds for packing, it is powerful, AND uses the ionic technology.  It is perfect for me.  I love that it is black and silver with the black part having a rubbery coating that keeps it from sliding off the countertop.  Excellent product!|pos
I bought this dryer after much debate over its price about a month ago.  I had decided the price was worthwhile given how much more expensive it is at regular stores in the mall compared to Amazon.  Although it is still on the pricey side, I feel this was an excellent investment.<br /><br />I have fairly long hair that I blowdry every morning, and this dryer really does speed up that process.  It's true that the dryer doesn't seem to blow with much force, or with much heat, but it actually dries my hair much faster than any of my old brands (conair, vidal sassoon) with less noise and without me working up a sweat.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it indeed makes your hair smoother or shinier... I have straight hair as is.  But coworkers and friends have been commenting a lot lately on how healthy my hair has been looking since I starting using it.<br /><br />I guess the other comments on Amazon not being an authorized dealer and therefore voiding the warranty can be a deterrant, but being able to save $100 compared to retail was significant enough for me to take a chance on that.|pos
I have owned two of this same product now.  Both have started to shoot sparks within less than one year.  Be warned.  This is a hazardous dryer.|neg
great dryer, works well.  Lots of heat and volume when I need it, nice cooling button.  Dries my hair fast.  Amazon got it to me overnight when mine died, so I only went 1 day with bad hair.  Not bad, because I don't have time to shop at the brick and mortar.|pos
I love this dryer.  I used a similar one at Planet Hollywood in Vegas and tracked it down when I got home.  I have wavy hair that always frizzes into a puff ball when I use a hairdryer.  I had switched from my old dryer to the Remington Wet2Straight which I thought was the greatest invention ever, but this dryer quickly replaced it.  The key is the high power motor, it gets my entire head dry in less than 10 minutes, with no frizz.  A quick run through with a straightener after I'm done is all I need.  Plus it's lightweight and quiet.  This product saves me at least 15 minutes in the morning that I used to waste getting frustrated with my hair...try it!|pos
I'm blown away (literally). This is the best hair dryer I've ever owned. Compact, powerful, super light-weight, dual voltage...for under $15...are you kidding me?! Flicked the voltage switch using a coin, and it worked great when we were in Italy. Andis Micro Hair Dryers rule!|pos
I love this hair dryer.  It is the best one I have ever owned in terms of making my fine hair look amazing.  I recommend this hair dryer to any one and be sure to use the large attachment to it for great results!|pos
I was sick of buying cheaper dryers and having them break after a year, so I decided to spend more on something professional. This hair dryer is quieter than any other I've used and dries my hair in half the time! It is definitely worth the money.<br /><br />UPDATE: It is now 3 and a half years since my initial review and I am still extremely pleased with this hair dryer... It was definitely worth the investment!|pos
Nicest blow dryer we've ever had!  Actually does reduce frizz and dries extremely fast.  Worth every penny!|pos
This is a great hairdryer. It's light, and dries my hair fast. I was worried about frizzy hair, but the dryer doesn't make my hair frizzy.|pos
This is an excellent prouduct. It eliminates friz and drys your hair in half the time. I love mine.|pos
it's sensational.  very  happy with the price and service from the shipper.  my hair has never been smoother or shinier.|pos
This blow dryer gets really, really hot. It's a great product for a great price.|pos
It's a hairdryer.  It blows cold air over a heating element and makes it hot.  That hot air evaporates and carries away the water in your hair, making it dry.  Hardly rocket science.  It does all the above well.<br /><br />The ion function only works when the cold blast button is pressed, so I don't have to worry about where all those extra electrons hangin' off the negative ions will end up.<br /><br />The overall slow speed of the fan coupled with the diffuser makes a nice, safe warmer for cold winter feet, too.|pos
I used the dryer for about a year.  One day I was blow drying my then 6 year old daughter's hair when sparks started flying out of the dryer.  I freaked out!  I am trying to get a replacement but the company is giving me a hard time because I bought it through Amazon and they are not an authorized re-seller.  Don't waste your money.|neg
The quality of this product was horrible.  When you held it, you could feel how cheaply made it was.  I was very dissatisfied.|neg
I have curly, medium-length hair.I bought this dryer in the begining of the year thinking it would produce less frizz. After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair. My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable. Since the dryer was the only thing I changed in my hair-care regiment, I figured that was the answer. When I couldn't stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer. Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn't as dry and frizzy. I hate this dryer because of all the damage it did to my hair. And, although I did not experience the sparks, it short-circuit on me on a weekly basis.    I don't recommend this product to anyone, especially for people with curly, think hair.|neg
Lasted 7 months.  In that 7 months it sporatically shuts itself off.  Now its completely dead.  The manufacturer won't warranty it because amazon is not an authorized dealer.    My $10 conair has lasted at least 15 years!  What a waste.|neg
This is the best dryer I have purchased. I own about 4, and this one dries my hair the quickest without frying it. Some dryers use very high heat, but not enough power.   This dryer is also not as heavy as other ones I have used. The price is good for the quality.|pos
This is a great blowdryer.  I had one before and this one is a little different, but it works great.  I love it!  Compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn't do, which is a great feature for traveling.  High speed - dries hair quickly! Very fast shipper too!  Thanks! Love it!|pos
This is our third Oster Wall Hair Dryer.  We've used them in hotels while on business trips and thought it would be great to have one at home.      We love these hair dryers because they are easy to use and efficient.  We don't have to reach under the bathroom sink to pull it out every morning or find a place to plug it in without bumping into anything else on the counter.  It takes up very little space on the wall and is very easy to install.|pos
I was really excited when I bought this $269 dryer for $39 several months ago, but when I started using it I noticed immediately that it didn't really feel like it was drying my hair faster. It actually felt like it took longer than usual. So I went back to Amazon to search for product specifics and couldn't find the wattage for this dryer anywhere. Imagine my surprise when I did a Google search and found that this dryer is for ethnic hair and has a powerful  1300 watts. POWERFUL 1300 WATTS? Are you kidding? No wonder it sucks. Maybe it's good for ethnic hair, but for a caucasian girl with long fine hair it just adds about 10 minutes to my drying time. Don't waste your money on this unless you are looking for a dryer that puts out as much air as a floor fan. The people who wrote rave reviews on this must have been brainwashed by the deal they got. No way would I ever pay $268 for this dryer. The cheapest Wal-Mart travel dryer has more wattage than this!|neg
I have never spent this much on a hair dryer before in my life. But one weak moment I ordered it and I am not sorry one single bit. In this case, you DO get what you pay for. It has a lot of drying power but does not blow your hair to the point it frizzes or feels really dried out. First this threw me because I was used to more hot air blowing out but after I finished using it on my hair for the first time, it was amazing. No over blowing, my hair felt softer and in better condition, and for some reason straighter and more styled. No need to hesitate on buying this. I'll never go back to a cheaper hair dryer again.  If you are still trying to justify spending the money, look at it as saving money on extra conditioner for your hair.  This thing is wonderful.|pos
This hairdryer is much more powerful than the Conair I previously owned as it dries my hair in nearly half the time. It is a tiny bit quieter, but still makes a decent amount of noise (about the same as a powerful hand vacuum). It is a perfect size for any bathroom (we bought a white one for one bathroom and this black for another). The only thing I would change is to make the power cord recoil as it is nice and long, but must be wrapped up after each use or left to hang. That said, I still highly recommend this hair dryer.|pos

ANDIS BLOW DRYERS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THE ONES YOU BUY IN CHAIN STORES.  THEY DRY YOUR HAIR MUCH FASTER AND MAKE WAVY HAIR EASIER TO STYLE. THE ONLY PROBLEM I FIND IS THAT THEY ARE HEAVIER THAN THE STORE STANDARDS AND YOUR ARMS GET TIRED. I RECOMMEND THIS DRYER TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GREAT LOOKING HAIR FAST AND EASY|pos
Arrived promptly, packaged well - and works great!  Perfect heat (doesn't fry your hair), nice attachments for directing heat to specific areas (I have very, very thick hair), great cord length, and perfect weight. This is a very simple, easy to use, and effective hair dryer at a nice price. I love it!|pos
I am so pleased with this dryer.  Works great and is so handy in my bathroom.  Now I don't have those cords hanging all over and it doesn't take up counter space.  Very handy.|pos
Got one for my brother for his birthday also!  Two for the price of one on Amazon!!    We are amazed and awed with the improvement in texture and shine of our hair.  IT travels GREAT also!    Thanks Andis for such a wonderful product!|pos
Bought this hairdryer a month ago and as we speak it is in a landfill somewhere.  What a piece of junk.  Just stopped working one day.  Would'nt turn on at all. To return it would be more of a hassle and expense than its worth and Conair knows this so they continue to produce inferior products knowing they won't get them back.  The retractable cord worked when it felt like it.  Don't waste your money on this one.|neg
No more mess in the kids bathroom. They love it and so do I. No problem with dryer strength. Lots of hair on both.|pos
I purchased this hair dryer after using on on a trip and it was the hair dryer that was supplied by the hotel.  I love the way it doesn't use a lot of heat.  I also loved the way my hair looked after using this product, the ends of my hair did not look fried.  After seaching the internet, I found that Amazon had, what I determined, to be the most reasonable price.|pos
This dryer is worth the money!  I've been using cheaper hair dryers for years and finally opened the wallet and invested in a professional quality one.  I don't notice that this dries my hair any faster, but it is shinier, smoother, and seems to have more body.  For someone who has hair that has all the body and styleability of dental floss, this is a huge improvement.  I like this hair dryer and I got a great price for it on Amazon!|pos
Purchased for domestic travel. Solid construction, compact, and the high heat speed has a powerful air flow for such a small head size. Drys hair fast. Has low heat speed if you need it. Very satisfied with purchase!|pos
THIS DRYER DOES NOT BLOW VERY STRONG AND TAKES A LONG TIME FOR HAIR TO DRY.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT EVEN THOUGH PRICE IS GOOD.|neg
The second time I used the hair dryer, it stopped mid-drying and never worked again!  A total waste of money.|neg
I am very happy with this dryer; it is light, strong, and the retractable cord works much better than the last one I had. It is also not overly bulky. I highly recommend it, especially for the very reasonable price.|pos
My conair hair dryer stopped turning off the other day so I started searching online for a new one (I do this about every 1.5yrs b/c they eventually die on me).  Happened to come across this hair dryer and was intrigued though not sure what to believe.  After all, it's *just* a hair dryer and ridiculously expensive!  It got good and bad reviews so I figured I'd try it out.  I decided to buy one at Nordstrom because if I didn't like it, I could return it and if I did like it, I'd have the full warranty.     To my surprise it did an AMAZING job and I'm not very skilled at styling and blow drying my hair at the same time.    I washed my hair with the same shampoo and conditioner I've been using for a few months and I towel dried it a little but my hair still felt very wet.  I did not put any product in my hair afterward like I normally do.  I used the hair dryer while sitting on the floor in my bedroom and used my brush as usual and dried/brushed it without a mirror.  It definitely dried my hair faster than other hair dryers, but I'm not sure how much time it shaved off overall.  When I was all done, my hair felt nice, but nothing stuck out UNTIL I looked in the mirror!  It was nice and smooth (no flyaways) which I can usually only get this look when I use shine/smoothing serum on my hair.  And when I do that, I'm looking in the mirror and constantly brushing/styling as I'm drying it.  This was actually pretty effortless and I'm thrilled that I didn't have to put anything in my hair to achieve a nice, smooth, professional look.  Very impressed after first try and I'd recommend this hair dryer to anyone.|pos
am in the market for a fabulous dryer for my natural african-american hair. I have heard rave reviews about the T3, which my stylist uses. However, the concerns regarding whether the manufacturer will honor the warranty if you buy from Amazon turned me off. I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty.|neg
If you are looking for a dryer that will get your hair real straight and dry your hair fast this is the dryer for you. The dryer is very hot and you have to be very careful not to put the heat on your scalp directly.|pos
I bought this for my wife when her old one started making a hideous shrieking noise. She is happy with it so far. It doesn't get stupid hot so it doesn't damage her hair. That is important to her. She has never mentioned it feeling heavy so IT'S NOT. Trust me, this 94lb woman asks for help lifting a gallon of milk, so really you should be fine.    I don't know about the ION aspect, I mean it blows hot, dry air. Even the box it came in didn't sound too convinced, using phrases like ions may be emitted, which could possibly make hair shinier. Whatever, it does the job, and doesn't wake the dead.|pos
This blow dryer dries my hair quickly with no frizz. I love it and love the color. The only thing that might make it better is if the output was a lighter higher/harder, but it gets the job done well.|pos
This dryer gets the job done: just want it dry?  It's fast and powerful and you can easily direct it.  It also comes with two attachments, one for straightening, the other for zeroing down on problem areas.  I love the color too - it's bright and cheery.|pos
I purchased this dryer and it was defective.  The casing simply pulled apart at the handle and the screws that should have held it together could not be tightened.  I ordered a replacement (which came right away, thank you, Amazon) and it had the same defect.  The handle simply pulls apart.  I don't think that's my bad luck - I think there is a problem with the assembly.|neg
I've always thought that Oster produced great products but not this time.  I purchased this hair dryer in November 2007.  This morning, without warning, it started smoking and glowing bright red inside.  I was able to pull the plug (the GFI never tripped).  I won't be buying another one of these hair dryers.|neg
I bought this dryer to take on a European vacation with me. I was thrilled with the size when it arrived. I used it a few times in the States before I left and it worked great here.  When I got to Europe, I tried to change the voltage on it and was totally disappointed. The voltage changer looks like you would use a coin or a screw driver to turn it. When I turned the knob, it fell out of the appliance completely revealing that it wasn't attached to anything within the appliance!! It was just a hole with a little black plug that seemed to be put there to make it look like it would change the voltage. Of course, as soon as my traveling companion plugged it in the 250 volt outlet, it began to smoke. What a rip off!!!  I have hair that must be styled and I had to buy a hair-dryer to use while in Europe.  I would never recommend this to someone buying it for overseas travel. It simply doesn't change voltage.|neg
I blow dry my hair every morning after my shower, works great,   light weight in my hand...|pos
This is the second dryer I've purchased.  It is a powerful compact   dryer and I recommend it highly.|pos
This item is just what I wanted.  Enough power, ion, and the diffuser and concentrator attachments are great.  The retractable cord is very convenient.  I highly recommend this product.|pos
great dryer,quite, does the job. the best dryer i have ever used. my hair is very curly and it gets it straight with out much work.|pos
Hard to believe a hair dryer can make such a difference!  This one does.  Hair feels amazing and it's incredibly fast.  Can't beat the price either.|pos
I've been using hair dryers since 1975, and this is by far the best I've ever owned. It reminds me of the way hair dryers used to be designed: moderate heat but high air flow. That's the correct way to do it. (The cheap mass-market hair dryers started getting this backwards around the time they all transitioned from squirrel-cage fans to radial fans. Heating-element wire is cheaper than decent fans motors, I guess; and if that turns a hair dryer into a blowtorch, so what -- people who don't know any better will buy them anyway.)    This particular unit has a very long round cord. I can't vouch for the cord's durability, but I see no reason it wouldn't hold up. Even if it were fragile, though, I'd still want to own this hair dryer. Cords are easy to replace. I've put two on my massive GE steam iron, an old-timer from the 1960s.    In summary, then, this dryer is tough, heavy, quiet, comfortable, extraordinarily effective, and obviously built for the long haul. It is far, far above anything I've seen in the stores since squirrel-cage motors disappeared some years ago.|pos
I am surprised to see that it is hard to put away in case and I would like a way to talk to someone on the shipping for $19.99 and it took almost 5 days to get, I WON'T BE ORDERING AGAIN. If I was to get a call and get a refund, I am concerned about the bad reviews that I have seen for this product.|neg
I thought it worked great the few times I used it but I should have heeded what others wrote here.  The bonnet is very cheap and became unusable after only a few times of use.|neg
I was not too sure about this with all the other reviews, but I bought it anyway. Well I'm so glad I did, this works great for me. I have medium hair about shoulder length. I put it on medium and it dried my hair with curlers. It never shut off, in fact it was a bit warm. I don't know if the other people got defective ones, but mine works just fine. Good luck to anyone else who buys it.|pos
I spent several weeks researching hair dryers before making this purchase.  This dryer was recommended to me by my hair stylist.  I have very thick hair with a slight wave (just enough to be annoying - not completely straight or curly) and was looking for a dryer that would cut down on frizz and dry time and just plain make it easier to dry my hair - this has done it all.  It is also very lightweight and much quieter than my previous Conair dryer.  Now to be honest, this is the first expensive dryer I have ever purchased so I can't personally compare it to others out there on the market, but I read every review I could get my hands on before buying and I didn't see any negatives where other expensive dryers (T3 for instance) seemed to have just as many unhappy customers as happy ones.  Even though it was quite expensive I don't regret it one bit.  And, even though FHI won't honor their warranty if you buy it from Amazon, Amazon will honor the manufacturer's warranty.  It was much cheaper here.|pos
I've owned many hairdryers over the years...they seem to last a year or so then die a quick and sometimes painful death.  None has been anything to get excited about.  I decided to take a chance on the Farouk Deep Brilliance, based on the great reviews, great price, and the Farouk name.  Some may be put off by the bright orange color, but mine gets stowed in a cabinet, so it's not a decorative accessory. The quality is outstanding and hopefully will be around more that a year or two.  Even more impressive is the way it styles may hair.  I have short hair and the high setting dries my hair in no time.  I love the lower setting for styling with my round brush.  It still provides plenty of heat to set the curve, but the air velocity doesn't blow my hair off the brush.  My hair looks much shinier but with lots of volume.  Fantastic!|pos
I Love this hair dryer so much.  I used it at a friends house several times and finally just bought my own.  Sephora sells it for $216 (after tax) and Amazon-$145.  Money well spent!  My hair is long and thick and it usually takes about 12-15 minutes to dry and that's after I've towel dried it, applied makeup, fixed the bed, etc...  My T3 takes 4 minutes, I've actually timed it.  I know its, just a hairdryer as my husband would say but if you are anything like me in the morning every second counts. I love it and Amazon always comes through with the best prices!!  Can't wait to buy the straightening iron!|pos
I've had my Bespoke Labs 83808-SE for a few months now and really love it. I have thick, wavy hair and am really hard on my blow dryers - and I've had many over the years. This one is, hands down, the quietest, fastest-drying dryer I've ever had, and it makes my hair shiny and smooth, not frizzy. The lint filter is easy to access and clean. In brief, there's just nothing not to like about it. It's pricey - but, given that I've gone through one or two lower-priced blow dryers every year for the past heaven-knows-how-many years and that it seems like this one's going to last a long time, I think it's actually the most economical choice.|pos
This is an excellent hair dryer that out-performs the cheezy and inexpensive brands out there. Do not get cross minded when choosing this hair dryer because it get the job done right. Some people complain about how heavy this thing is and I can only tell you that any professional hair dryer is going to pretty close to this weight. Overall, this hair dryer is the best you can get for the money and it will perform as described.|pos
I decided to try an inexpensive hair dryer for the first time since money was tight, and now I really regret it.  I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one.  After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it.  Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out.  It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before.  I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair!  Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower.  Please stay away from this dryer!  I'm glad mine never shot sparks like the other reviews I saw but it doesn't surprise me.|neg
I love this product.  My hairdresser told me to buy it and I couldn't be happier.|pos
first hairdryer arrived damaged, second hairdryer only lasted five months before overheating.  Now what, I have no box to return the item but I am going to let the company know my dissatisfaction with their product and see what happens.  I'm going back to Conair!|neg
Very pleased with this product. Drying time is cut in half compared to other blow dryers!|pos
This is THE LAST time I order anything but books thru Amazon.  I have a major probelm every time.  I ordered the Featherweight Dryer with a Diffuser.  Instead I got the Special Edition with NO DIFFUSER for more money!  There was NO CONTACT information on the order -- NO PHONE NUMBer -- I called Amazon and got no help at all.  I had to spend more money to Order the Diffuser.  So I ended up spending more money and did not get the product I ordered through the Amazon site.|neg
We got this for a trip and it was great because it had a folding handle and retractable cord. Made packing super easy. It got real hot and I recommend it for anybody that needs a great dryer.|pos
I bought the first one and hung it on the wall in my guest bathroom.  Within two months, it went dead.  Bought a second identical one and it went dead in the same period of time with no one using it.  Too bad because I really liked the light and it worked great when it worked.|neg
I've owned this dryer for only a few weeks, so I cannot speak to its longevity.  This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.  Update on 2011-12-29: I cut my hair shorter last April and no longer use the hair dryer.  It was still working perfectly after three years.|pos
On the 5TH DAY of use EVER, this drier burned off a WHOLE SECTION of my hair! I smelled burning and turned off the drier, ran my hand over my hair and the whole section fell to the floor!  The hairs were scorched and melted together.  My hairdresser always comments on the great health of my long hair, I've never processed it, I never even get split ends, so that's not even an issue here.  I bought this drier because my last Revlon drier was great.  Never again! I've complained to Revlon, still waiting to hear from them.|neg
I got so fed up with this dryer, I gave up on it after just a couple of months.  I now (very happily) own a [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223 Cord Reel Folding Handle Dryer]], which, despite Amazon's title, does not have a folding handle.    This was my second hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient, but there are several things I really hate about it.  It is very noisy and I have to turn the radio up loud to hear the news--even when using the slow speed.  You should be concerned about hearing loss if you use this.  The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand.  I have to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I prefer to use high heat and a slow speed, but that is not available on this cheap piece of junk.    I highly recommend you do not waste your money on this hair dryer.|neg
I purchased this for my trip to florida where I would be staying with friends who didn't have a hair dryer... this is a wonderful little dryer. I have recently been a backpack traveler and this folds down and fits in any bag you would want to travel with.|pos
I'm frustating too. I bougth this one the last year, and yet I can't dry my hair one time. Its terrible. Bad, bad. Dont have power.|neg
So powerful and efficient at its job. Smaller than I thought it would be but not too small at all!|pos
The retractable cord has already stopped working...probably haven't used the dryer 10 times. It won't stay out!|neg
[[ASIN:B000K7JLGM T3 Bespoke Labs 83808-SE Featherweight Professional Ionic Ceramic Tourmaline Hair Dryer]]    This dryer is dangerous, and doesn't work well at all. Yes, it dries hair. There is no standard temperature setting, you can just have high strength or low (wind level, not heat) and it is so hot i've burned myself and my hair on it. Because it gets so hot, it's own internal temperature regulator SHUTS IT OFF all the time in the middle of drying. The only way to turn it back on is to wait until it decides it's ready to go again (several minutes of sitting.) It is quieter, but who cares, if it's quietly burning your skin and hair? i am actively pursuing a refund, don't waste your money.|neg
This product drys your hair quickly,therefore causing less damage. It is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair.|pos
This is the second time I purchase this product and I am satisfied every  time.  I recommend it.|pos
Like many out there, my last Conair dryer lasted nearly 20 years.  This new Conair was very good for the first 6 months but now it only wants to remain in the convenient fold down/storage position.  It's like someone broke it's little red neck.|neg
My wife has had the dryer for 4months now.It started not heating up as much in the last couple weeks, now it just blows cold air.Went to look for the warranty caus' one of the reasons I bought this $200 dryer was the fact it had a 5yr warranty...NOT!!!!.....I started looking for the serial number only to find it had been removed from the box(you can clearly see the location where it used to be and was torn off!)  I came back here to check it out and found all these posts on non-authorized reseller bull$!!it.I do alot of research when I buy stuff, making sure I pay enough money to get quality and not buying cheap.  There is no way to know Amazon is not an authorized reseller.This has been a complete rip off.Make sure you heed the warning....BUY ELSWHERE.  Make sure it has the serial number on the box!I'm really pissed about this.Now we have to spend more money on another blow dryer.This sucks!!|neg
Let me address the title of the review. From the very first day she used this thing, she started getting compliments about her hair. Her hair is normally pretty straight and flat, and it definitely had more body.  It was also less frizzy after she got done drying it for whatever that's worth. The compliments are fading now that her coworkers are used to the new look, but my wife is still raving about it.<br /><br />I purchased this for her because I got tired of repairing or replacing all of the crappy ones she bought over the years. The latest one I put to rest dimmed all of the lights in the house when it was coming online. She and I needed a change. I read all of the good reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />The Elchim is everything I hoped for in a hairdryer. The first thing my wife and I both noticed was that it was MUCH quieter than any hair dryer she had ever used. Its highest setting is equivalent to most hair dryers' lowest setting.  We can actually hold a conversation now if we need to while she dries her hair. I figured it was up to my wife to protect her own hearing, but I was very concerned when she dried my daughter's hair.  It definitely defeats the myth that louder is better or more powerful.<br /><br />Secondly, the quieter airflow was very powerful. 1500 liters/minute is the claim. I haven't ever seen another volume measurement, but it sounds impressive, right? Anyway, as others have stated, my wife dried her hair in about half of the time that it took her normally. She thought I was nuts when I showed it to her and it did not sound like a fighter jet, but she was pleasantly surprised. It has a removable filter screen (twist-off) on the end to keep the airflow at its peak which will prove invaluable over time. The buildup of hairspray, makeup, lint, and whatever else will be easy to remove without completely disassembling it. This congealed mess has contributed to the deaths of other hair dryers in the past.<br /><br />Elchim is a professional brand and they build their products for heavy-duty use. It has a thick round cord, which will be much less prone to tangling. It is smaller than almost every full size hair dryer she has owned.  It has a sleek design as opposed to the ones with the cylinder sticking out the side to house the motor. This will prove great for packing. I expect it to last for years.<br /><br />I read many mixed reviews about the ionic dryers, Tourmaline, ceramic heating elements, EMF, etc., but none swayed me away from common sense. See below:<br /><br />The ionic dryers are supposed to trap moisture in your hair. A few things on that: Moisture = weight. Weight = flat. Conditioners are still the best thing to protect your hair and give it shine without weighing it down. Many use wax, which is much lighter than water and gives body and shine without weighing the hair down.<br /><br />There are also claims about breaking down the water molecules to smaller sizes. Science note: Breaking down a molecule of water (H2O) leaves hydrogen peroxide (HO) and a free hydrogen atom (H). We now have that answer for fuel cell cars and bleach blondes, right? Ionic dryers don't heat the air, they heat the hair from within. Isn't that what microwaves do? There are good Ionic dryers out there, but be wary of the claims. Some people claim that ionic dryers also cause dry eyes and headaches. I did not see a need to risk anything like that.<br /><br />Last thing about ionic dryers, the cheaper ones use technology in which the ionizer does not last. A good ionic dryer will cost you more than the $29.95 delivered! versions. Read the reviews, none of the 5-star reviews for the cheaper ones is after extended use. Many of the lowest reviews complain about inconsistency, lack of performance, and breaking down altogether. If you want a good ionic dryer, be prepared to spend a little. If the cheapies were the answer, they would be in use in the salons.<br /><br />Bottom line: Your hearing matters; protect it.  Proven technology matters; ignore the hype about trapping moisture in the hair you are trying to dry. Ergonomics matter; pack-ability, weight, and hand comfort might make or break you on how you feel about your hair dryer. My wife's arrived in all black...so what. She never paraded one around in the past, and I don't expect her to anytime soon. They only make black, white, red, and red-black, no neon or orange surprises. There is no substitute for quality and durability. While you may not always get what you pay for, if you buy cheap things, the adage holds true.<br /><br />I researched these things thoroughly before I bought it and read several reviews where people were using their Elchim hair dryers for 10+ years. I have no doubt that this will follow those lines. Salons around the world use them several hours per day. Ours should last for years. Well worth the $60-ish I paid.<br /><br />*** Update - Feb 20, 2010 ***<br /><br />After about two years and NO abuse, the cord on my wife's hairdryer crapped the bed. What is weird is that it broke about three inches down from the rubber protector that goes into the handle. I expected any break would be at a bend where the protector ends or inside of the hairdryer where it is internally clamped. It broke where it should have never been an issue. I cut the cord about two inches from the solder points, where I thought the break would be, intending to solder back on. As it turned out, the intermittent wiring was about three to four inches further down from my original cut. When I dissected the failed portion, it looked like it had been accidentally crimped or kinked in the manufacturing process. I still hold that the hairdryer is top-notch. I will repair the cord on the next one I get, if I get the same model. Why do I need another one? Read on.<br /><br />For the guys out there saying no biggy, I can fix a cord, beware. For the record, this thing is a BEAST to disassemble and reassemble. Iwork with all sorts of electronics. When it originally failed, I opened up the hairdryer thinking the electrical problem was internal. Once I was inside, I saw the problem was not there. However, there were two wires in there that broke with little maneuvering and prove near impossible to repair. After reassembling the hairdryer, I could not get the screws seated well enough to feel safe when in the hands of my wife or daughter. I threw it out after MUCH frustration and solder. It did work when I got it back together, but the exposed screws in a wet environment caused me concern.<br /><br />I regret doing this because I was the person that posted the pictures of the cord and how it would never break. Alas, I was wrong. I think I will look for a newer/different model by the same manufacturer. I DID NOT contact Elchim to see how much a repair was. After shipping both ways, I'm sure it would have been up there with the cost of the dryer itself. I did email them a detailed description of the failure though. Nobody has replied to that letter. My wife hates the replacement dryer(tourmaline) and wants her Elchim back.<br /><br />For all those that I doubted: I'm stupid. You're smart. I was wrong. You were right. You're the best. I'm the worst. You're very good looking. I'm not attractive. (from Happy Gilmore) I thought about posting pictures of my failure, but what's the point. I edited a picture previously posted noting where the item eventually broke. Good electrician, possibly a good deal. I would change my star rating, but it would remove my review from the most helpful spot. If you read this far, you must have felt it was helpful too....or at least amusing?<br /><br />*** Update - December 2013 ***<br /><br />When the last one died (my fault) three years back, I didn't replace it because she had purchased a cheap stand-in while I wrongfully attempted to fix the cord. She simply kept using it after I killed the Elchim. I put up with screaming our morning conversations for longer than I should have waiting for the cheap jet engine to die. Well, it lives on, but my patience broke. I reluctantly coughed up the money for a new Elchim. Same model, just different color. OMG, it's so much nicer to not have to listen to that screaming menace in the morning. We can actually talk to each other if necessary while she dries her hair. She'll probably appreciate life more once she can heard birds singing again. I felt a bit stupid after I killed the first one, and I didn't want to augment that feeling by spending $$$ for a hair dryer when she already had a replacement. Now that I swallowed my pride and replaced the Elchim, everyone's happier...and I'm sure we hear a little better too.|pos
This was an excellent buy and a great product.  I saved around $20.00 as compared to discount stores in my area.  The shipping was supposed to be 5-7 business days and I received it in 2 days!  I am always very satisfied with amazon.com purchases.|pos
This thing has unbelievable bang-for-buck.  It's compact, comfortable, and powerful.  If you need a compact hairdryer buy this one. You won't be dissapointed.|pos
I do my share of traveling with work and personal.  I noticed that I always used the hair dryer that was hanging up in the hotel bathroom.  I rarely used it at home.  I realized the convenience of ready to go made the difference.  No more cords to untangle before plugging in.  I am extremely satisfied with my new Andis 30975.  Plus now there isn't an ion to be found on my head.|pos
I bought this hair dryer based on all the glowing reviews I read about it.  So of course when it arrived, I was excited to see just how fabulous a job it was going to do drying my hair.    Okay for starters, this thing has 2 settings:  slow and hot, fast and heat-of-a-thousand-suns hot.  The setting that this dryer has for low on the heat side would be about as hot I would normally dry my hair...but since there's no speed setting to choose from, I'd be in the bathroom for about an hour trying to get my hair dry.    The thing is a little clumsy to hold and the nozzle is just slightly bigger than a silver dollar so there's not even a LOT of air coming out of it.    I turned it on, used it for about 2 minutes, repacked it into the box and came out here to immediately begin the return process.    Save your money.  This thing isn't the savior of hair care products like other reviews would lead you to believe.  It's overpriced for what you get and not impressive at all.|neg
This hair dryer has 2 speed's, slow and slower!  It takes forever to dry hair.  Instead of looking forward to getting ready I dread washing my hair knowing how long it will take.  I have had this dryer for 1 month now and am looking for a new one.  If you have thin hair this may work for you, but I have thick wavey hair and this dryer has no power or heat to style me.  I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for this product...this is no salon dryer!! Very disappointed :(  Try hot tools ceramic hair dryer for @ the same price (amazon has none in stock at the moment) but it is an awesome dryer worth every penny.|neg
This is absolutely the most amazing hair dryer EVER! I purchased mine about 7 years ago and I use it every day. I love the gail force wind that it sends out to dry my curly thick hair in no time at all. It is a bit heavy, but I do not leave home without it when I travel. My girlfriends love it when I bring it, too! Well, after 7 long years together, I am sad to report that it died. Ugh! Thanks to amazon.com I'll have another in just a few days at a fraction of the cost of my original. I hope to have another fabulous 7 years with this one!!|pos
It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  Also, it's much quieter than my previous one with all the added power.|pos
Used this hairdryer in a hotel on vacation and loved it so much I had to order one for home as soon as I got back!  Doesn't have a separate selector for temperature, and seems to be hotter on the higher setting that the lower ones, but it works just great for me.  Would definitely recommend.|pos
DO NOT BUY THIS PRODCUT ONLINE - IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THIS PRODUCT FAROUK WILL NOT FIX IT.  THEY WILL TAKE YOUR SHIPPING MONEY AND RETURN THE DRYER BACK TO YOU WITHOUT LETTING YOU KNOW THAT THE PRODUCT CAN NOT BE FIXED - WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT THE DRYER ONLY BLEW OUT COLD AIR  THIS IS A PRODUCT MALFUNCTION AND THEY WONT FIX IT FOR ME|neg
I never realized a hair dryer could actually make your hair feel soft! This one does that and dries my hair in 2 seconds. Okay - maybe not 2 seconds, but it really is fast.|pos
Oster Professional 76932-710 Wall Mount Hair Dryer<br /><br />Reasonably priced and works like a charm.|pos
This is a great deal, it heats up quick. The shape it blows is perfect! Who dries in a circle? Not I, Easy to handle and can be stroked like a brush! Best part: intake screen is an ease to clean! Worth Every penny.|pos
I love this dryer! I'll never buy a less expensive one from a discount store again. This one is quieter and even though it doesn't blast you with hot air (like the less-quality ones), it works really well. My best friend bought it first, and her hair is un-managable most days. She loves it, so I bought it too, and I love it. A great deal too!|pos
i was skeptical, but after using this product,it dries my hair much faster and with less frizz|pos
Purchased this for a gift and the person I gave it to keeps thanking me for the purchase. Suppose to be one of the best out there.|pos
This was a replacement for a Jerdon hairdryer that we had had for years. The new one has a sleeker look, is much quieter, & does the job (drying your hair) faster.|pos
I have long, thick, wavy hair that usually takes anywhere from 30 to 40  minutes to blow dry.....with this blow dryer it was cut to 15 minutes!  Besides the time issue most blow dryers drive me crazy because they are  so loud, not this one ..it's much quiter than the average blow dryer.  I had seen this a few other places at varying prices- all way more than  the $40 I paid at Amazon. The only draw back is that it's a little more  heavy than other blow dryers.....but I figure that's good for my arms!  A great purchase!|pos
None available.|pos
I have been through a lifetime of hairdryers and this one tops the list! It's powerful but doesn't blast your hair beyond recognition...especially at the lower speed and on warm. Not having to deal with wrapping up the cord is such a plus...the retractable cord works beautifully and saves space in my small bathroom.|pos
If you value your hearing do not buy this item.  It was so loud that the first time I used it, it was unbearable.  I was excited to have a wall mount dryer, but not worth it at the extreme noise it makes.  I put it into my yard sale box and sold it.|neg
This is a great hair dryer- it works fast and my hair has never looked better. I never thouht i would spend that much on a dryer, but it has been well worth it.      I almost didn't get it because of the reviews on here about unauthorized dealers and whatnot. It was a great price though so I went ahead anyway. I'm glad I did! I don't know if somethng changed, or if those reviewers were just looking in the wrong place for the serial number, but mine had everything needed in order to register it with no problems.|pos
This wall mounted hair dryer is so nice... I also have the Sunbeam 1500 but I prefer this one.  It easily comes off the cradle, it is fairly quiet (compared to the Sunbeam) and the design is just more user-friendly.  Spend the extra few bucks on this one!  It's a great product.|pos
IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS DRYER.IT IS JUST AS GOOD AS MY CHI DRYER.THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST.THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT.I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DRYER. IM A HAIRDRESSER AND EVERYONE I WORK WITH WAS INTERSTED IN IT WHEN THEY SAW THE COLOR OF IT.IT REALLY WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS MY OLD CHI DRYER.|pos
Love this item.    Very Quiet    You will Love it  :-)|pos
This is a great dryer. It blows hard which is what I wanted. I have short bleached hair. I don't use the attachments. I haven't noticed that the ion feature has done anything different for my hair. It has a nice long cord which I also like. Some reviewers have mentioned it being heavy. Not true, maybe for a three year old, but not an adult. It just feels like a nice solid, well made dryer. It's louder than my last dryer, but not too loud. I don't think that whole ion thing does anything no matter which dryer you use. My hair is the same, with or without ions. What smooths it out is the fact that it blows nice and hard. That will probably change though as the filter gets clogged inside. That remains to be seen. I'm happy with it.|pos
[[ASIN:B0009XH6WS Andis 33295 Hangup Pro Turbo 1600W Wall Mount Hair Dryer]]  Motor would not start. Thus returned.This is my 3rd Andis as I love wall mount type in my bathrooms. Previous 2 did not last very long. Found there are other brands and therefore, changing.|neg
EXCELLENT, I love my Farouk D.B. Hair Dryer!  As a mom I don't have hours to style my hair and feel good... but now with this flat iron (and I also got the Farouk Deep Brilliance Flat Iron) I can straighten/style my hair in 20 min (I have just over the shoulder length hair that's wavy).    I want to add, I first learnt about Farouk Chi products from my sister who got her flat iron and hair dryer as a gift from a friend who's hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron/hair dryer but packaged as Deep Brilliance line.  Same great product different packaging and on sale!|pos
Great dryer. Works much faster than my old Conair did, and does not leave my wavy hair frizzy. I noticed that I did not need to use my flat iron following use of this dryer unless I just wanted to, which is great (less heat damage). Having only had the product for about a month or so, I can't speak to the longevity of this product, of course, but it seems quite durable in comparison to drug store brands. The shipping was incredibly fast, I must add.|pos
great hair dryer, dries hair very quick! my daughters have very long hair and they love it as well. it is the same model the pros use.|pos
I have been very happy with this hairdryer. It is fast and leaves my hair shinner than my old hair dryer. Love it.|pos
This is the best hairdryer I have ever owned. I have waist length chemically straightened hair that is normally  thick course and curly hair. I have about 5 inches of curly re-growth and I don't need to use my flat iron to blend it in with my straitened hair. This dryer dries super fast and leaves hair soft and less frizzy. Very quie too. I use minimal product on my hair now with this dyer. Well worth the money. I'm buying one as a back up and have recommended it to many of my friends. Love it!|pos
LOVED this hair dryer! Didn't even need a new hair dryer, but at this price, I couldn't resist. I figured my old one would break eventually. I decided to make sure it worked, in case I needed to return it. WOW! I couldn't believe how soft my hair was! My hair is healthy, shoulder length, a little wave, a little frizz. I usually had to tame with Biosilk Silk Therapy after drying. But with this dryer, I don't need to use anything! My hair is silky, bouncy, soft and pretty. It dries faster than my old one and it's quieter (big plus since my baby's bedroom is right next to the bathroom.)|pos
Just what you would expect for a $250 blow dryer!!! I work at a hair salon and have told all of the girls about this deal! The air is HOT HOT HOT, it dries my hair VERY quickly and my hair is no longer frizzy and a knotted mess after I blow dry it. It is SOOOOO QUIET which is exactly what I needed (my other dryer was incredibly loud). This dryer doesnt even sound like it  is on. It has a Low & High, and 2 heat settings... its working great for me! I would HIGHLY recommend.|pos
This blow dyer is the best and a deal at this price! I used it and it was SO quiet I couldnt believe it. It also took no time to dry my hair even on the medium setting. I have thick ethnic hair and it left it very manageable and soft. I recommend this dryer. Its not a looker but it gets the job done. Whoever said it was heavy is mistaken, its not heavy at all. The comb attachment is great also.|pos
This hair dryer is the BEST!  It dries your hair in half the time a regular hair dryer would do it.  It really helps for an on-the-go mom!|pos
T3 is the best hair dryer I have ever owned.  I'm a 50 something professional with thinning, color-treated hair that is frizzy and easily dried out.  This machine leaves my hair shiny, fuller and healthy looking with no friz.  Feel like I have a new head of hair.  Will buy a 2nd dryer for the office.|pos
I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment.  When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.<br /><br />Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn't believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn't even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn't even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn't working properly.<br /><br />I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.<br /><br />If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.  I'm just glad and lucky that the sparks didn't land on my hair and cause a fire or anything.|neg
Oh My Gosh...This hair dryer is So perfect.  I opened the box the night it arrived at my door.  Took out my new hairdryer, plugged it in, and WoW!  You could just Feel the Power, Yet So Quiet, But So Strong!  It heated up immediated.  It's very well made of high quality materials. Take it from me, I am one of the biggest sceptics you could ever meet.  I love this hair dryer so much, I am afraid to show it to one of my dearest friends for fear of hurting her feelings, as she just got a new pink CHI hair dryer for Christmas.  Personally, I do believe this is the same Exact hair dryer, it just doesn't have CHI printed on the side of it.  Who doesn't love Orange...Go Illini.  Thanks again Amazon for carrying such High Quality Products...I am thrilled that I have found you.|pos
On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair.  After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy.  Frankly, if you're going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!    Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them.  They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.      Don't buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products.  They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either.|neg
I bought this hair dryer in hopes that it would do a better job than my old Revlon Ceramic Ion dryer. My hair is almost shoulder length, very textured and thick.  With my old Revlon it took me 20 minutes to dry my hair. I've been using this dryer for one week now and it takes about 8 minutes to dry my hair. While it dries hair quickly,  it's extremely gently and leaves my hair softer and more manageable than it has been in a very long time. I'm thrilled with its performance and the price can't be beat!|pos
If you want a high end hair dryer for the right price, you've come to the right place! I was looking into Chi hairdryers ($200-$300) when I found this one by Farouk. I decided to go ahead and try it out, and I love it! The comb attachment is my favorite part - it kind of massages my head while I use it and it makes my hair less frizzy (and that's saying something since I live in Texas!). The nozzle attachment is also easy to use and gives a great blowout. It's just a great hair dryer and I recommend it to anyone!|pos
It takes half the time to dry my hair and is very quiet.  I like the fact that you can clean the air filter as apposed to my previous hair dryers! Would highly recommend!|pos
Great little dryer with lots of power. Compact size and wall mount save space. Don't let that compact size deceive you, though, because it dries hair very quickly.|pos
I bought the T3 featherweight for my wife as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3.|pos
I researched all the hairdryers on amazon, and this one seemed like a great product at a great price.  Unfortunately, one huge design flaw has prevented me from using it.  The cord keeper function broke after about 3 months of use, so in order to use it I have to either     1) Be within 12 inches of the socket, or   2) I have to fold the cord up after pulling it out and hold on tight the entire time I'm drying.      A very frustrating experience. Buyers...beware.|neg
I have used this dryer for almost 3 years now. My daughter liked it so much that I bought this for her this Christmas. She now is as happy as I am.  It is fairly light weight but has the power of a professional.|pos
You can't get much for $20 these days.  However, an Andrew Jackson will get you the Conair 209R Ion Shine 1875 watt hair dryer from Amazon.com, and your even have some change left over!  This dryer produces an impressive jet stream of air, with a selection of 3 heat settings.  The technical specifications boast Clouds of negatively-charged ions neutralize positive charges that are in the air and reduce the static electricity that causes fly-away frizzies and dulls hair.  Well, I don't know what all of that means but I will admit that my hair is not frizzy after using this dryer.  There is also a cold-shot button, which quickly removes heat from the air output, which is a great feature.  The dryer has a little weight to it, but it is not bulky and seems to be balanced quite well.  All hair dryers are fairly noisey but this Conair 209R Ion Shine is quieter than most of my previous dryers.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this model, the built-in cord retractor, seems to be getting negative comments from other reviewers here on Amazon.  Common sense tells me that I should hold onto the heavy power adapter with one hand while holding in the cord release buttong with the other.  You easily control the retraction speed this way, which prevents the end from whipping around as most people are complaining about.  It's really not a big deal and doesn't take much effort on the user's part.<br /><br />I do wish that this dryer had three air speed settings, since high is sometimes too harsh, and the low setting is usually too soft.  Overall, for less than $20.00 this is a real bargain of a hair dryer and I couldn't be much happier with my purchase.  Thanks for the great deal Amazon!  =o)|pos
This has cut down on my drying time and is very gentle to my hair.  While it is expensive, it is well worth it.|pos
Works great; same dryer used by my hair stylist.  Here's the caveat:  Since I bought it from DiscountJungle via Amazon.com, the manufacturer would not honor their 4-year warranty.  They told me they only warranty products sold (at full retail cost) by their authorized vendors, adding that hair dryers sold by Amazon.com or by DiscountJungle were often used (not new) or knock-off copies of their product.  The manufacturer strongly recommended that I return the product to DiscountJungle, and buy one from their website, or from Nordstrom (one of their few vendors); then the manufacturer assured me they would warranty the hair dryer.  I phoned DiscountJungle, explained all this to them, and was assured that mine was brand new (sure looked new to me), and that DiscountJungle would honor the 4-year warranty.  I got that in writing from them, and then I was able to start using the hair dryer.  It was no fun going through all this.  Just be prepared...|pos
With a four year warranty I had to try it and now I'm in love. It doesn't take an hour for me to dry my hair..WITHOUT blowing all of my curls apart in a big frizzy mess. It is one of the lightest full size hair dryers that I've owned. It is reasonably quiet and the buttons are in the right spot and don't accidentally turn on and off while drying. I have long permed curls and having a good hair dryer can make or break my day. After MANY throw away dryers I think I have found a new best friend.|pos
My husband got me this expensive blow dryer for Christmas after hearing me complain how long it takes to dry my long hair.. that of which I recently chopped 6 inches off.  I have a new baby, and would rather spend my time with her instead of drying my hair - so this seemed like the perfect product.    I have long, fine-ish, straight-ish hair.  After giving this dryer a good week for a test drive, my hair only seemed flatter and had more static.  Just to make sure it wasn't the weather or my shampoo, I tried my ol' $20 Conair and the life came back to my hair!     Bottom line - feel free to try it out, but I'm spending my money elsewhere.  Also be warned about the serial number missing!!|neg
This is the best standard blow dryer on the market.Plenty of power and heat.Nothing else compares.This will keep that 80's hair blown back for shure.This was made for Bon Jovi & Rod Stewart types.|pos
I made this order. after i got it, i found out it wasn't working. i plugged it & it refused to come on. it was a pure waste of my money because what's the point if i can't use it. i should have gotten something better or more mature. Now i regret buying it.|neg
This is a good high end hair dryer at a cheap hair dryer price.  After my last cheap one stopped working, I saw this and figured I would splurge.    Why I am happy...  It is light and quiet.  It dries hair quickly.  It has a long cord.  The comb attachement is handy and securly clicks on. It is BRIGHT orange so you will not lose it ;)    Both myself and DD have fizzy hair.  After drying her hair with the comb attachment is was softer and less frizzy.   The result was wow.    My hair....used the dryer as I was brushing my teeth and wiping down the counter so it still came out frizzy but when I used my CHI iron on it, the process was quicker and my hair was smoother.      This is a good product.|pos
only problem (?) is it takes some pressure to release the button for the cord to recoil, but that is about it. i like it and it works great!|pos
this is a great product - i wish i had bought it years ago!  works great, was easy to install - i love it!|pos
I am very impressed by this blow dryer.  I have had blow dryers before which I have purchased at Target or Walgreens but when my current one broke I thought I would try a more expensive one.  I was even happier to get a more expensive one at a great price.  This dryer dries the hair fast without frizzing it out.  The hair dries soft and maintains shine.  My hair felt so much more silkier than with my other blow dryer.  The dyer is also light weight which is a plus.  I now know it pays to get a more expensive model.  You won't be disappointed with this one.|pos
I was really surprised when I gotr this hair dryer.  It was way better than what I expected for the price.  I was really thrilled and I am really satisfied with this product|pos
I absolutely LOVE this hairdryer. My hair is healthier, shinier and I feel like I'm done in no time!|pos
I was really looking forward to this. Got it in the mail. Plugged it in and it did not work. I am sending it back.|neg
I have very thick coarse hair and I usually just let my hair air dry because a blow dryer makes it look puffy and takes so long that my arms get tired.  This dryer really does dry your hair fast and it made my hair look very smooth.  My husband (who notices nothing, usually) even asked me what I had done to make my hair look so great.  The retractible cord is nice because it lets you store the dryer in less space without fighting with the cord.|pos
Lightweight and super fast.  With a vented roll brush, this leaves my hair looking sleek and healthy in record time.  I can't remember the last time that I left the house with a completely dry head of hair...it used to take way too long to dry.  Not anymore!  I also like the little bling added to the handle of this special edition (SE) model.  Worth every penny.|pos

Not only does this dry my hair faster than my older dryer, and it's light, it actually creates lasting body for my fine straight hair that I've never had, and leaves it shiny and looking like a million bucks. Best $130 I've spent in a long time, and cheaper than more frequent hair cuts, that's for sure.|pos
My hair gets dry and brittle very easily. Since I was younger I've avoided using hair dryers, except for in the winter, because they would make my hair so dry it would look gray. I decided to purchase this hair dryer due to its advertised features. I was not disappointed. I have had long hair (down to mid-thigh) all my life and it takes only 10-15 minutes to dry with this dryer. I was so happy with the dryer I decided to buy one for my Mom (who also has long hair) for Christmas. I would recommend this hair dryer to anyone who has long, or light colored hair that gets frizzy or looks overly-dry easily... especially in the winter months if you live in the north - like I do. The filter works well and is easily cleaned. The dryer itself is quieter than any other hair dryer that I've owned. Great buy. Very Happy.|pos
Pros:  - Fits well in hand and is easily maneuverable  - Puts out high volumes of air at a high-enough temperature  - Very compact; fits in a very small space  - Night light is surprisingly useful; it lights the way to the bathroom without being so bright as to be distracting    Cons:  - Power cord length is not adjustable  - Included mounting screws/anchors are flimsy    I bought this Andis dryer to replace a similar type Conair unit that died after about a year's use.  My wife's habit of leaving her non-hanging dryer and tangle of cords all over the sink and vanity motivated me to get a replacement fast!    The dryer does its job -- drying -- very well.  The compact handset is easy to maneuver and it puts out a surprisingly high volume of air at the right temperature, which is a must for those with long or extra-thick hair.    This is the smallest unit of its kind I've seen.  The mounting bracket is barely wider than the dryer, which makes putting it into tight places a snap.    The relatively minor disadvantages have to do with the installation.  First, the power cord length cannot be adjusted.  It is one continuous cord from the bottom of handset, through the mounting bracket, and down to the GFCI power plug.  Some competing dryers have an electrical junction in the bracket which allows you to shorten the wire running from the bracket to the wall outlet and makes for a neater, tangle-free installation.  Second, and this is a quibble, the enclosed mounting screws and wall anchors are pretty flimsy.  I substituted a better pair I had sitting around in my toolbox.    All in all, this product does what it is supposed to very well and, despite a couple of one-time installation issues, I am very pleased with my purchase.|pos
I've read the reviews and have to admit I really don't understand the Ion thing but whatever it is, it sure seems to be working.  My old dryer conked out so I decided to purchase this one.  With my hair looking quite damaged recently I wanted a dryer that wouldn't make it worse. I changed shampoo at the same time so I'm not sure which did it, but my hair looks so much healthier.  I have fine, straight hair and lots of it and I'm still finished drying in 5-6 minutes.  Much faster than before without the static and damage.  Love the setting controls; I use the warm, high setting and it leaves my hair really soft and healthy looking with no frizz. That alone is worth the modest investment in this product. I haven't used the attachments and don't think I will need to - a nice bonus but not something I require. I saw reports of sparks and singed hair and will be on the lookout for those things, but so far I'm extremely pleased and may order a second one for my daughter.  Kudos Revlon!|pos
Abolutely love this! It hangs easily and is one of the best dryers we have owned!|pos
The best, hands down! My long, thick, naturally curly hair dries in 3 minutes and is flawless and straight! I use this in conjuction with the revo styler, resolve or lavei shampoo. I also use sleek look or sleeking conditioner. Then I finish sparingly with my own version of Ojon oil.    Even other Andis blow dryers can't touch the performance of this one. Neither can the other way more expensive blow dryers.|pos
I love this dryer.  It has improved the texture and whole condition of my hair.  My (African-American) hair is less frizzy, smoother and calmer.  I'm buying two more for my sisters as Christmas presents.|pos
This is my 2nd Conair hair dryer with the Cord Keeper in the past 5 or so years and I have been very pleased with both of them. I had the smaller model with the fold up handle first which traveled with me AND was used almost daily at home until something went wrong with the plug. This one is heavier but I like the way you can adjust the heat and the speed settings, rather than just high/low/off. I LOVE the internal Cord Keeper - would hate to ever go back to one without that feature!|pos
I bought 2 more , 1 to replace the bathrooms that was used by 4 girls constantly!! And the other for our friends that loved the convience.  For around 18 bucks these powerful dryers are tough. The one that died needed to be replaced after almost 2 years of hard work. Remember there not just practicle but safer with kids! And the dim night light is a bonus. (I am now thinking about selling these on the street). <JUST KIDDING  Trust me when I say you will enjoy! Banb|pos
i'll be honest, the only hairdryer i've consistently used (other than borrowing friend's and such) is my mom's crazy 20 year old one.  and i was looking to get a hairdryer for college, especially since i didn't want to be caught out in the cold with wet hair with the temperatures dropping.      So I researched a little, saw that this one got pretty good reviews, and bought it.  It's a decent price, not too heavy, and after less than 10 minutes, my thick, below the shoulder, layered hair was completely dry.  And it looked like i'd just come back from getting my hair done.  Amazing.  My hair feels soft and silky.  I had no problems with accidentally turning the switches on or off (honestly I don't see how you could unless your fingers wrap all the way around the handle), my arm didn't get tired (you're only holding it for less than ten minutes, when does it have time to get tired?!), and air stream is pretty strong.      My only problem is that my hair looked a little dry, and the dryer didn't look THAT professional, but those are minor issues.    Overall, I'm a fan.|pos
I have owned one of these for over 5 years and couldn't be more satisfied.  I originally paid $40.00 and thought that was a high price, but after years of faultless performance, I'd pay that price again.  I'm glad I don't have to because now the price has really come down.  This small hairdryer has more air force than all the big clunky ones I've used in the past.  The telephone type cord is rugged and will stretch as far as 10 feet.    Excellant product in every category.|pos
I bought this wall-mounted dryer to free-up some space in the kids bathroom, and it works great. The nightlight is nice and bright and the dryer isn't too loud. The bracket mounted easily once I pounded the raised Ground screw terminal flat. The bracket won't lay flat against the wall with the raised Ground screw terminal on the bracket. The cord hook on the dryer mounted easily and works wonderfully. I've only had it a couple of weeks, but everyone in the family really likes it.|pos
The Conair Blackbird is the best non-professional hair dryer out there. Multiple settings and 2000 watts make for fast drying without burning!|pos
great except that it's bulky (not good if you need to carry your hairdryer when traveling).|pos
I have owned this hair dryer since 2000, and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  This blowdryer is super quiet.  I did not notice that it took any longer to dry my hair with this dryer versus my older 1875 watt dryer.  I bought it primarily because it advertised the quiet motor.      It is somewhat heavy, but once you get used to it, it is no big deal.  I dropped this dryer probably a couple hundred times and it continued to work just fine.      Recently I noticed it was only blowing cold air and assumed that the heating element went out.  I was going to throw it in the trash.  Lucky for me, I didn't get around to it.  It is the perfect sleep soother for my now 8 month old daughter.  It was just loud enough to break her crying spree and get her focused on sleep, plus, since the heating element went out, we don't have to worry about her/us accidently touching a hot dryer.  It is amazing, we turn it on and she immediately plops her head down on my chest and is out like a light in just a couple of minutes!!  Wonderful, amazing on those rough days when nothing else seems to work.      I enjoyed this hair dryer so much that I have just purchased two more.  A back up for my daughter's restless episodes and one just for me!|pos
I had seen this dryer reviewed in InStyle for a couple of months and had considered purchasing it.  I have very natural curly hair.  The reviews said this product was helpful in taking the curl out.  After trying other products I decided to try this.  I was pleasently surprised.  I have alot less frizz than before.  Even thought the power is not tremendous that is not a problem.  The dryer gets very hot and really straightens my hair.  I really like that it is light weight also.|pos
Unfortunately, like other reviewers here, my Conair 1875 watt ionic cord keeper died after a few months of use. While it was working it was excellent. But I don't expect a hair dryer to die after just a few months. Buy something else!|neg
I bought this product about 6-7 years ago at a local store and loved it.  When it wore out I was so happy to find Amazon had the identical item. I couldn't believe how fast it arrived and it works just as good as the first one.  I really like having the wall mount design and it's simple to use. A great price for a wonderful product!|pos
I'm amazed that people described this product as heavy. I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced. I'd be stunned if it held up any time at all.|neg
I have always loved using these great hair dryers at hotels and thought it would be great to have one att home, and it is.  No more messes on the counter or sink, and you never have to wonder which drawer it is in...|pos
I've been using this dryer regularly for 8 months now and it is a great deal for the money. The retractable cord and folding handle work fine. This is my first ionic/ceramic hair dryer and I am not at all disappointed with this purchase!|pos
I bought this hair dryer for college since it was a little smaller than the others and it works great!  not too loud...not very soft either...two settings for heat...just a normal, everyday dryer that operates when i need it to.|pos
I bought this item and when it received the box was in bad shape, the dryer work, but the light didn't. I sent it back in the same box it was received and they returned one that didn't even run. I would not reccommend this iten to anyone. I bought the same one from target and it works gread. I would recommend you not to order it from amazon.|neg
I love the Jerdon 1600W wall hair dryer.  This is the second one that I have and it works great.|pos
We were traveling and in one hotel my husband commented this wall mount hair dryer is great!  Next morning I ordered one from Amazon.  It arrived 3 days later and he is a happy man!|pos
This review is for the T3 'Overnight' dual-voltage hair dryer.  I have just used it overseas and I am thrilled that both the low and high settings work on the 240V setting (every other dual-voltage hair dryer I've had in the past only worked on the low setting overseas).    This hair dryer is excellent because it is lightweight and dries my hair very quickly with much less frizz than ordinary hair dryers. I also purchased the T3 Tourmaline Diffuser and love it because I have naturally wavy hair and it leaves my hair with nice waves, much less frizz and it does not feel crunchy and dry at the ends - just nice soft waves.  I can't say that it leaves my hair completely frizz free but definitely softer.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer.|pos
I have thick African American hair.  This straightens my hair quickly and I don't need to work SO hard when flat ironing my air with this.<br /><br />I also suggest buying a nice ionic hairbrush like the CONAIR and if you use flat irons, you can find a really good IONIC brand without spending Chi money.  I have the Titanium Tools Jilbere de Paris flat iron.... whatever it is... works for me and cost me around $50. Half the Chi price.  Get the Biosilk or the Chi silk Infusion (use a small amount) to protect your hair... they last a long time and protect your hair.<br /><br />You will rarely need a salon with these ingredients.|pos
I was skeptical about the ceramic disk/ion feature, that it would actually reduce the static electricity, fly-aways & frizzies and make my hair shinier and more manageable.  How could a thing that blows air do all that?   I knew I needed to look for something new though because after using my old blow dryer, my medium thick, wavy, frizzy fly-away hair was not presenting itself in a pretty way but just looking worse and worse.  Any grade of shampoo and conditioner didn't seem to make a big difference overall.    It got to be where I just dreaded the task of doing my hair.    After using this Conair dryer one time, my crown of glory was good enough to go as-is if I didn't have time to use the flat iron.  This is a 100% improvement over my old-no-special-features blow dryer which has been retired to probably dry pets and mittens and boots or whatever.  Now after using this Conair almost daily for about a month, I wish I had learned about the technology way sooner and saved myself a lot of angst over how to tame my hair.   I love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments (I don't know which I like best), that it is light weight, has a sufficient length cord, dries my hair quickly, isn't overly loud, and most of all that I can SEE that my hair is in better condition.|pos
This dryer is most definetely worth the money.  I have naturaly curly/frizzy hair.  This dryer gives me soft, smooth hair in less time.  The dryer is less weight and less noisy than all of the others I have tried.  This dryer is the best!!|pos
I bought this dryer at Amazon in order to get it for $125 less than the MSR.  In 6 months it quit working completely and I contacted Amazon about it only to be told that it was past the 30 days.  I emailed Amazon a few time before posting this, in order to give then a chance to make it right, but they offer no help at all.  This is when I learned that these hair dryers are ONLY sold through authorized dealers and Amazon is not one of them.  So my hair dryer is possibly a copy; it is certainly not under any kind of warranty and I just lost that $175.  The real deal is a fabulous dryer and I would suggest buying it for the full $300 and having a 4-year warranty on it.      Amazon is one of the places online that I have always felt safe making purchases, but no more.  Please be aware that you're taking a chance that it may not be authentic and it might fail, and, if it does, you will have just lost a lot of money because there is no support for it.|neg
I bought this product Dec 8,2006, and it lasted till Aug 20, 2007.  It's not worth the cost to ship back.  It just stopped working.  My last Conair hair dryer lasted some 15 or more years.  Think I'll check out some other brands by checking out these great reviews on Amazon. Don't buy this hair dryer, you will be greatly disappointed.|neg
I highly recommend this hair dryer.  I have very thick hair with slight wave, and for years I'd let it air dry just to avoid the excessive blowdrying time required and damage that ensued.  My mother-in-law has this model at her summer cottage, so I'd use it when we were there.  Typically, one doesn't put as much effort into vacation hairstyling, but despite that, my hair always turned out better while away than when at home.  Though it's quiet to the point that I hadn't expected much power from it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it very efficient.  It dries very fast, doesn't scorch your head, and adds a healthy shine, too.  I'm replacing my current hair dryer with this model.  I was hoping to make a trade with my mother-in-law, but she won't give it up!|pos
I already own 3 different hair dryers from this brand. Love them and will never go for anything less than that quality.|pos
I was looking for a new hair dryer b/c mine did not have the concetrator attachment and the universal wouldn't fit.  So I found this one and it had a great price and had pretty good reviews on other websites but a great price here.  I got a great deal with the flat iron as well.  It's perfect.  It drys my hair much quicker and my hair feels softer and looks better than it did with just the regular hair dryer.  I would absolutely recommend this item.|pos
I've had two.  First one quit working in 2 months.  Replacement ALSO quit working after 3 months.  I still haven't gotten all the gory details on WHERE to send this second defective unit.  Plus, I have to pay to ship it there AND include a check for $14.95 for processing.  Some warranty. It may be 4 years, but is it worth the hassle - time & expense - of returning every 3-4 months?  The worst part is that the first one was a gift from my sister-in-law and she was mortified so handled the first replacement...the store kindly exchanged it for her.  She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn't they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don't want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don't have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.  You'll love it for the 3 months, miss it for 2 months while awaiting the warranty info/replacement...and then the cycle will begin again.  I have very thick hair with waves and it works wonders and leaves my hair shiny.  But, geesh, I could never recommend it to anyone.  $200 and I have to send it back for warranty every 2-3 months.  Hello??? Bespoke are you listening????  My friends would never forgive me if I recommended such a poor quality product to them.  Now that I had to prevail upon my sister-in-law to get her receipt, and I have it in hand, I can now spend my money to send the thing back.  This has added 3 weeks to the delay, but I have FOUR YEARS.  At this rate, they will probably wait until just about the end of that period to send me a replacement so the new one will be out of warranty practically when it arrives.  I got the first one in late Dec 2006.  The second one in mid-Marchlay, but I have FOUR YEARS.

This hair dryer was recommended to me by a coworker after I commented on how nice her hair looks. Sturdy construction, retractable cord, great price, and my hair looks much better with this blow dryer than others in the same price range.|pos
I was actually giddy the first time I used this because of how it made my hair so smooth and full of body.  This baby plus a little mousse work wonders.  My hair is fine and not extremely thick, and this dryer does a great job of giving me extra volume when I want a more glamourous look.  I feel it was worth the splurge, although I'm glad I bought it when I did (a few months ago) because the price has since gone up on it.|pos
Was very skeptical about buying a hair dyer that is expensive but it does do the job more quickly than the lower priced hair dryers. It is also lightweight and does not dry your hair out.|pos
Small and powerful.  It dries my hair as fast as my full-sized dryer and doesn't take up nearly as much space.  Also, my hair (which is prone to fuzziness when blown dry) doesn't come out fuzzy.|pos
It was not quiet and not fast. The supposed ionic function is a bunch of hooey. Fine, for the price I could just say, whatever. The ion thing was just a sales gimmick I fell for. Unfortunately, after a year of moderate use it suddenly developed a stench and then died in about 30 seconds. No, it wasn't clogged with hair or anything like that.|neg
Tacks onto the wall very nicely.  It comes with double sided thick tape and places for screws.  I used the tape and haven't had any problems in over month.    I saw these in hotels all the time and loved the convenience.  Now I don't have to deal with dragging it out of the closet every morning.  It's right there hanging next to the mirror.    I found it to be plenty powerful, and not too hot.  The lower setting is good if you don't want to disturb someone who is sleeping.  The high setting is powerful and loud.|pos
I was unable to keep this product due to the fact that the products box was not sealed and there was not a serial code attached to the hair dryer.  This code is necessary in order to register it for it's 5 yr warranty.  When I informed Amazon of this problem, they sent me another one, and this too did not have a seal and bar code.  This only leads me to wonder where are these dryers coming from?|neg
A bit old fashioned, but I've had one around for years!  They work for me!|pos
I bought it in the middle of December 2006.  Today June 18, 2007, I turned it on to use it and it burned out and smoke was coming from the vents.  The plastic around the slot the tube goes into broke twice..had no choice but to stitch it with thread to keep it attached to the plastic cap.  So disappointed with this product.  Don't buy it.  Better to spend the money and buy professional.  This product is not worth the 40something dollars I paid for it.|neg
I have fine, wavy, fly-away hair that is prone to bushing and frizzing even in non-humid weather and until I found this dryer nothing could smooth, straighten and calm down this wild animal on my head!    This dryer is like a miracle!  Even in hot, humid weather I can walk outside and not feel my hair shrivel and kink up.  OK, there will be a little frizz, but not anywhere near as much as before.  I'm telling you, if this dryer can work this well on my hair it can work for anyone.  I've tried other expensive dryers that women rave about and they were all a waste of money compared to this one.    First of all, let me warn you that if you are expecting this dryer to be anything like your old dryer you are going to be let down.  In just about every way this dryer makes you think it's not up to the task but if you give it a chance you'll see that it is light years better than anything else out there.    For instance, this dryer does not seem to put out a lot of air.  People tend to think it doesn't have enough power but that's not because it isn't working, it's because it doesn't need to blow your hair to smithereens in order to dry it quickly and thoroughly.  And the benefits from not having to deal with all that wind are amazing.  It actually gives you better control over your hairstyle and doesn't poof up your hair.  If you curl your hair around a barrel brush and pull it tight, then pull verrry slowly down to the ends while following it with the dryer, it will dry your hair far more efficiently and smoothly than if you had to deal with tons of wind blowing your hair all over the place.  The only thing is that it takes some getting used to the lack of wind because you are forced to handle your hair differently.  Once you get the knack of it, though, you will never want to go back to your old dryer again.  I feel so much less stressed out using this dryer, too.  It's quieter, lighter and doesn't require gymnastics to achieve amazing results.    Another thing is thatthe dryer is amazingly light - it weighs just over half a pound!  Again, the control this affords you in being able to hold the dryer at strange angles indefinitely without feeling awkward or tired is amazing.  I used to think that only a professional could dry the hair on the back of my head and style it well, but now I can do it myself to perfection with this dryer.  This dryer is so easy to use you will have more energy when you leave the bathroom.  I'll swear it takes less time to dry my hair, although I haven't estimated by how much.  It feels like it takes about 25% less time than my old dryer, which was also a professional ionic/ceramic dryer.     One thing that is strange about this dryer (but not in a bad way) is that at first I thought I was seeing smoke rising from my hair when I used it.  This alarmed me because I thought I was damaging my hair.  Now I realize that this is most likely the humidity being blown out of my via the miracle of modern science!  It has no smell and it seems like water vapor.  I had seen this effect a bit with my old dryer, but it happens a LOT with this dryer.  All I know is that my hair comes out silky, smooth, and since I've been using it, in MUCH better condition than before.  I sometimes feel like I've used a relaxer on my hair!    The only complaint I have about this dryer is a small one and quite minor in the scheme of things.  The control buttons are in an awkward place on the grip of the handle and it is easy to accidentally turn the dryer off or change the speed or temperature.  There are 2 independent speed controls and 3 temperature controls.    Other than that, I find the lower speed virtually unecessary because the higher speed is versatile enough to use for any purpose.    In general, I would highly recommend this dryer to anyone regardless of their hair issues.  I often see women with thick curly hair act as if their hair type is the hardest to handle and if a dryer can work on them it can work on anyone.  Well, they never had fine, fly-away, kinky, curly, bushy, virtually weightless hair that will not be tamed for love or money like I do, so I often wonder just who has it harder in that department!  But regardless of that, I think that anyone who wants silkier, smoother, straighter hair will be more than happy with their results with this dryer.  Personally, when I have seen bad reviews of this dryer I think it's because the person hasn't learned how to use it yet and is expecting it to act like the average hair dryer.  If you have that reaction I would suggest taking some lessons in blow drying techniques because I am pretty sure that will solve your problem.  This dryer has taught me so much about how to dry my hair successfully that I am almost in debt to it for an education as well.  Now if they can only come out with a model that will shine shoes too!  ;-)    UPDATE May, 2008:  I have now owned this blow dryer for about a year and despite daily use it's still going strong with absolutely NO issues whatsoever and I am still thrilled with its performance!|pos
If you depend on a hair dryer to style, and you are going overseas, this product is a must.  Compact, rather powerful, and has a dual voltage feature.  Definitely well worth it, and very affordable too.|pos
Having recently broken my wrist and also having hand function issues, this is the perfect dryer for me. I also loved the price and it is supposed to be a high quality dryer that should last for years. So what else could you want? I have never used more than high and never use those cool shots or ionic type dryers. This fits my needs perfectly. Love it!|pos
I have been using the hair dryer for almost a month.  It works great and has nice features like the cool air blast and the night light.  To me, it is a lot quieter than my old dryer, and mounting it on the wall only took a few minutes. The night light is perfect for the size of bathroom it is in.  If the motor lasts longer than 3 mos. (which is all my Jerdon dryer lasted,) this is an excellent product!!!!|pos
I used it for 3 weeks and the motor made tons of noise and then stopped.  It did not work well from the beginning and the motor got worse with each use. I used it about 10 times. I was Sooo disappointed.  At the price it was not worth returning..I dumped it.... what a waste of money . I am so upset with this conair product.. You get what you pay for. THe plus is the bonnet was soft...I kept the bonnet and threw out the dryer.|neg
The Andis 33805 Micro Turbo 1600W Dual Voltage Hair Dryer is a great little personal grooming appliance.  It has two settings: Low and High.  I use High almost exclusively, even though I have fine, short, grey hair because I don't like to dawdle over grooming in the morning.  Its dual voltage selections (125V/250V) would come in handy if travelling (with an added plug adapter).  High produces a rapid stream of air that quickly heats up and stays at a steady, moderately high temperature.  Low is appropriate if you spend more time styling with some degree of heat--producing a nice smooth and fuller result.  However, I'm a Type-A character who wants the job done pronto, so this is my machine of choice.  All dryers sound a little loud right in your own ear, but a family member says that the Andis is quieter than the Sunbeam I recently replaced.<br /><br />I bought this device to replace a Sunbeam compact dryer, which replaced another Sunbeam, which was preceded by at least two Conairs, and a parade of various compact (mostly) dryers over the last 32 years.  This is the BEST of the lot.  I actually gambled and bought two at once because compact dryers are getting hard to find now, and my confidence has been rewarded.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick solution to get going in the morning after your shower, look no further.  This one's a winner!|pos
This blowdryer is not worth the money!  I bought it less than a year ago and not only is the claim cut your blowdrying time in half a lie, (it takes me 1 hr and 15 minutes to blowdry my hair), lately it has been blowing out cold air all of a sudden in the middle of my blowdrying session.  Also, if you don't purchase from an authorized dealer your warranty will not be honored.  The t3 bespoke labs people don't even have an official website!  This is a farce! Don't waste your time and money.|neg
This is the nicest hair dryer we have ever owned. <br />this is number 3 we have purchased over the last 10 years. <br />the first cost $90.00 and had no night light.  <br />Now we buy the ones with the led night light uses little to no electricity. the dyrer is wonderfull. we bought it because the hotel we stayed in florida had them and thought what a great idea. no more wires or the unit on the counter. we also thought it must be good for everday use by different types of people. we really love it. <br />It will go into our new 2 baths so I will be buying two more soon.|pos
night light went out after 2 months,  i found out the warranty was only for 1 month..... this is a good product but the warranty sucks. <br />I am going for a full refund through American Express.. not through Amazon .lost in the woods...|neg
I have a very old Conair Prostyle 1600 - my favorite hand held dryer, and after over 10 years, it's been on its way out.  I've tryed various dryers, but none of them have the great feel of my old Conair.  I just recently ordered the Conair Yellowbird 1875...thought it would be great - looked just like my old one, only yellow.  I tried it once and sent it back.  It was too heavy..unlike the Conair 1600, which was oh so light...and surprisingly didn't have the blow power I expected.  So I read one review on the Andis Pro Style 1600 and it sounded good.  I tried it this morning and it's perfect - very light...and so small, I couldn't believe it.  I travel on business and have not found a travel dryer I'm happy with, so I'm going to order another of these for a travel dryer.|pos
It works. The cord feature is great. The price is right. What else is there to say.|pos
I love my ANDIS Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer, I throw it in my travel bag, it has all the power of a bigger, heavier dryer.    I love the retracting cord and folding feature, it stores neatly at home as well.  Awesome product.|pos
I bought this hairdryer as a gift for my 84 year old mom and it does not work as promised. The adjustment for height is hard to use the dryer doesn't dry the back of the hair, just the front.Also, it has collapsed while she was sitting under it , so not only doesn't it work properly but it is also potentially dangerous . I would definitely not buy this hairdryer.|neg
I travel quite often to beach resorts, I needed a dual voltage 220V hair dryer [not more than 1600 watts].  This hair dryer works very well.  I will buy soon an adapter plug [USA to Europe].  This is the best blow dryer I ever had.|pos
This dryer is the perfect size for travel and its performance is outstanding.|pos
This is a replacement for the same model hair dryer.  The first one lasted over 6 yrs.  I like the convenience of having it mounted on the wall rather than taking space on the counter.  I could not find one in the local stores and found the best price on Amazon.com|pos
Great hair dryer. I tried it in on of hotels, liked a lot and bought 5 for each room in the apartment. Powerful, nice grip, light and not too noisy. Great price, too.|pos
This hair dryer is identical to the one used by my stylist - and I paid the exact same price he did. I have some natural wave to my hair and while the dryer doesn't straighten every hair on my head, it does a better job than a regular dryer does. My hair tends to retain water, but I would say drying time is less than five minutes with this dryer (my hair is shoulder length). At my last cut, my stylist remarked that my hair is in good condition  - about a month after I'd been using the dryer. The dryer does get hot, but not to the degree my other dryers have. Granted, I don't have a warranty with it, but I'm very happy with this appliance.|pos
Okay, maybe not exactly explode, but very close.  After my 20+ year old Conair blow dryer was literally falling apart (but still working!), I decided it was time to treat myself to a new blow dryer a couple of weeks ago.  I have very thick, long, wavy hair that I usually let dry naturally after drying my bangs (maybe 5 minutes).  Yesterday I thought it would be nice to dry the whole mess and use the iron on it- something I may do once a month because of the time and effort it takes.   I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a hot smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don't use this setting very often, it's just using coils it doesn't usually use- wrong!  Soon it pops, hisses, and glows a nice yellow-red color before shutting off.  I then realize that even the grip is hot and that the snake of smoke coming out of the end of the blow dryer is a death knell for my brand new device!  I hope that maybe it'll work again after cooling off, much to my husband's amusement who said that smell only comes with electronic death, but no, it's forever dead.|neg
With below the shoulder hair, I found this to dry it quickly and without burning.  I have fine, thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment (to set a wave, for instance).  This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use. <br /> <br />The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair, but my arms (I'm 5'9) aren't long enough to make its use practicable. <br /> <br />Two speeds, two heat settings (plus cold-shot button) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently.  Took me less time than with my previous dryer.|pos
I dropped my last full-sized ionic hair dryer in the toilet, so I have been using the Andis on a daily basis now.  It works just as well or better and leaves my hair feeling silky and shiny.  I highly recommend it, if for nothing other than the low price!|pos
Dryer is very quiet and powerful. Easy to install. Night Light has a nice green glow. Highly recommend this product.|pos
None available.|pos
Okay, I haven't owned a new hair dryer for over 25 years, but I must say, this one is exactly perfect and has everything I would ever want in a hair dryer.  It has a retractible chord and is and dries my hair quickly, leaving it soft and frizz-free.  I highly recommend this product.|pos
After having read the majority of the reviews here, I'm happy to report that this dryer is fast and very lightweight.  My hairdresser who uses this dryer daily had recommended it to me awhile back. Unfortunately, I bought back then what I thought was a better more economical option: an Andis Ionic hairdryer with a retractable cord and folding handle. While very light weight and space-saving, I soon learned after several months of frequent use that either the cord was going to fray from from the retracting into the handle or worse, the handle could break from folding.  Well, it did.  After the handle broke, I decided to purchase this hair dryer and I regret not having done so sooner.  What a great hairdryer - very lightweight, dries hair quickly to a smooth satiny shine.  I have straight, medium length, medium thickness hair that usually would take at least 45 minutes to dry.  Well, the T3 cut the drying time to 14 minutes and that's taking my time. The T3 dryer is also very quiet and despite having only 2 speeds and a cold shot button, does the job quite nicely and I don't miss having all of the other speeds.  This was well worth the price and I wouldn't ordinarily spend this much on a hair dryer.  But the results are well worth it.  Highly recommend!|pos
I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it's retractable cord and folding capabilities. Even the price was attractive. It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus. I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly. Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.  I've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline (a featherweight, quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan.|neg
I recieved this product yesterday and used it first thing this morning.  I turned it on to high and the on/air flow button broke.  It is stuck on high and just slides up and down.  I had to un-plug it and re-plug it into the outlet to use it this morning.  This is made cheaply and is junk, do not spend your money on this dryer.|neg
I got this for christmas and I love it.  It is very high powered for being a Hello Kitty hair dryer.  I was surprised.  It is very cute with a great price.|pos
I have purchased four Jerdon wall mount hair dryers - one for my home and three for our lake house. They are dependable and affordably priced.|pos
I normally don't like to invest in hair products/items that are this expensive, so I thought I would ask for it from my boyfriend on Valentine's Day. He bought me both the Featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3. I love both of them! The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn't always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  <br />After using my t3 hair dryer, I don't know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that. Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon. This dryer is great for getting the job done quickly and to make your hair look better (without that frizzy, burned look that other hair dryers give you).|pos
I once recommended this dryer and should have changed my review years ago. The retractable cord feature on the one I bought initially very soon failed. I contacted Andis and they sent me another one, but it failed in the same way. I could not get excited about going to the trouble of fooling with it again. I no longer possess this product and could not recommend it.|neg
My wife loves the hair dryer (and she is fussy about such appliances) and my little two year old loves the retracting cord!  Good dryer at a good price.|pos
I bought two of these, one for each upstairs bathroom. The arrived quickly and at first glance, I was intimidated about installation. Then after reading the instructions, and seeing that they actually include a paper guide, you just tape to your wall and drill holes where the dots are... I installed both of these completely by myself! (I am a stay at home mom, so that IS a big deal!) It took no time and they both were up! They brace very solid against the wall. The dryer worked quite well and was very quiet compared to our old dryer. It also has automatic shut off, you can even hang it up while it is on and it will shut off as it is put back into the cradle. VERY NICE! I would buy again in a heartbeat!|pos
This dryer is absolutely wonderful.  My hair has never been so straight.|pos
I wasn't in the market for a new hair dryer but, thanks to my husband, who deep sixed my old one using it to thaw frozen water pipes at our cabin, I needed a new one. He thought the dryer just needed to 'rest' for a bit and then it would be 'fine' . . . so he didn't bother to tell me it had blown its last burst of air under our kitchen sink! I now needed to find a replacement hair dryer, something impossible to do on a Holiday when all the stores are closed and you need to be somewhere in half an hour!<br />FYI: If you, too, have a husband who has to thaw water pipes and has used your hair dryer, for that purpose, I suggest you point him in the direction of the [[ASIN:B00004TI25 Milwaukee 6 Dual Temperature Heat Gun]]. If he takes the hint you can avoid having to go to a 'Very Important Family Event' scaring small children (and some adults, I might add!) looking like a demented survivor from a shipwreck! I still cannot fathom why steam coming out of my ears and fire from the burning coals in my eyes didn't dry my hair! Where was a hot flash when I needed one? I'm over it - or I will be as soon as all the pictures and negatives have been destroyed! However, I digress, so back to my review.<br />I am glad I selected this hair dryer. It has proved to be an excellent choice. Dries my hair much faster and seems to leave it silkier which is saying a lot since I have gray hair that has a mind of its own. Oh, by the way, my Hot Tools Hair Dryer doesn't look too bad chained to the wall in our bathroom! ~ Mrs. B.|pos
This wall-mounted hair dryer was the smallest one available, and that is why I selected it. It fits perfectly in a small space, and it is as inconspicuous as a wall-mounted dryer could be. It works very well, too --it is quite powerful for such a petite dryer. I really love it!|pos
The initial reason for buying this hair dryer was to replace one that had died. My decision was based on price and product name and couldn't give a hoot about the ION feature. After a few weeks of use the woman who cuts my hair remarked that my hair felt smoother and was laying different. Good to know that it wasn't my imagination. Also, I found that the nozzle is a lot cooler than my old Conair dryer. It's so cool in fact that I don't hesitate putting it away immediately after use.|pos
My wife just loves this hair dryer - so convenient - no more hauling the old one out from under the sink, unplugging the nite-lite, etc.  And the nite-lite is great!  Those mid-night visits are safe and lighted - no fumbling around with those other 'soft-lights'.|pos
The first time out of the box trying the retractable cord, the button that retracts it got permantly stuck down. I am sure that this is a direct indication of the quality of Andis products - be fore warned!!!|neg
Light, Dual Setting, Powerful, Compact. An excellent product, very reliable. This is the second one I have owned the first lasted for eight years in home use and travelled the world!|pos
The very first thing I noticed was how small and crammed the case was. It was almost impossible to fit everything back in the case without thinking you have damaged something. <br />The other thing was how awkward the entire assembly was.  The bonnnet was difficult to get on, mainly because the hose connected to the bonnet was heavy and in an awkward place, and kept pulling the bonnet off my head. <br />After a couple of trys and reading the instructions, I knew I would never use it, simply because it was such a struggle just to get it on your head. <br />Whoever designed this product should be demoted.|neg
We have found the Andis to be comperable to the dryers found in the more upscale hotels. The hang up cord is a great feature that helps keep cords organized. The night light gives plenty of light for finding your way around the bathroom at night. Two speeds supply plenty of drying power. Nice design, easy to mount.|pos
First saw this unit at our time share in Aruba.  It is very compact, lightweight and extremely powerful.  It's works great.|pos
This is the second T3 I have purchased, the second was for a gift.  It dries your hair fast.  Saves a lot of time.  Well worth the price|pos
This hair dryer has a lot of power.  The wall mount keeps it out of the way, but readily accessible when needed.  This is a replacement hair dryer for us and we purchased the same one when the other quit working.|pos
This is the second Andis Hangup Hair Dryer we've had.....The first one was more than 10 yrs. old and ran great....We left it on the wall when we sold the house and moved....Got a new one for the new house...Couldn't be happier and love the night light feature...|pos
I have nothing but good review of this product. <br />Great product at a great price.|pos
After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined.  It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces. <br /> <br />I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair. <br /> <br />I would like to return it and get my money back!!! <br /> <br /> <br />|neg
I bought this item because I was going to Europe for a month. I didn't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time, unless you buy more than one converter kit. You do need a plug adaptor, (these are relatively inexpensive), then you just switch the voltage, plug it in and it works great. I used it in Switzerland, France and Italy. When I came home to the States I just switched the voltage back and I now use it at home. It is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase. I would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad.|pos
For me, this dryer has been fantastic! I have had it for 3 months and use it 3 or 4 times a week; and, I have no problems with it at all. It is compact, which means it takes up very little space. I would recommend it, based on my experience.|pos
Okay, long hair girls - DONT CUT YOUR HAIR!!!!<br /><br />I was seriously considering it, I had enough of the 30 min. drying time and then I figured why not try this blow dryer.  WOW, first time I bought something that was true to its claim, took me 10 min. to dry my hair instead of the usual 30 min., not kidding.  Best investment you can make and really is lightweight.|pos
I bought this hair dryer for a rental condo in a chic downtown community and it fits RIGHT in !|pos
An excellent product. It is very efficient, and, packable! Just what I needed for travel and days I need a fast set. Highly recommended.|pos
I recently got to try this hair dryer in a Marriott hotel and was pleasantly surprised. At home I had the Sharper image 1875W quiet Ionic hair dryer and this is what I am comparing it to. I went thru two of the Sharper images ones (first one broke) which are much more expensive and my biggest complaint always was that it scorched my head.<br /><br />Problems gone since I bought this. It is an awesome hair dryer. It lays in your hands comfortably, is sturdy and stores away in a breeze as it folds in the middle, plus you can retract the cord. On top of that it does not scorch or burn your head and also has the cool air feature (same as the Sharper Image) and my hair comes out nice, soft and never frizzy. At a price between $18 and $22 this is the hair dryer to buy. I did, and only wish I had known about this hair dryer earlier. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Update on 9/26/2009: Almost 3 years later we're still on the same hair dryer. The cord needs a little help to retract but nothing has given up on it yet. It has been dropped a few times too. For the price that is excellent and we have purchased a second unit for our other bathroom. Much better than the Sharper image version which is way more expensive, scorches your head and won't last long.<br /><br />Update 06/30/2016: the hair dryer is still going strong, cable retracting mechanism is broken now but that was not why we bought it in the first place. Almost 10 years, not bad at all!|pos
Plenty of power. Plenty of heat. Like the night light, but would like to be able to switch it off if I wanted ... but can't do that. If I kept this near my ears for a long time, the noise would be an issue, but since I don't, it isn't. Just a nice little device.|pos

A dryer that meets all your styling needs.  It's not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). <br /> <br />According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary. <br /> <br />Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.  But this is only a tiny flaw, as it more than makes up for that missing feature with its humidity resisting technology.  Well done, Remington.  An invaluable product for any styling arsenal.|pos
This hair dryer is the same or similar to units we have used in hotels when we have traveled. It is compact but powerful. The extra feature of a night light is very nice for our home use. We have one in our master bath and our guest bath and would recommend this item to friends.|pos
its too hot on the hot setting and too cold on the warm. try not keeping it too long on your hair when its on the hot setting. <br /> <br />good luck|pos
While I really liked the dryer's performance and the flexibility of using it with either the concentrator or diffuser attachments it came with, I'm really disappointed that it's burned out and inoperable after using it (not even daily or at the highest setting!) for under two weeks.   <br /> <br />Like another reviewer, I've waited a few days and tried resetting the plug and any outlet that I plug it into (all the outlets work with other appliances) and this dryer is definitely dead after a very brief run.  Since people are having such widely varied results, I can only wonder as to the manufacturer's quality control process, possibly letting through a few too many faulty machines...|neg
I just bought this and opened it up.  I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair. <br /> <br />I used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different - I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking.  It may have spit out sparks as I felt something hit my head.  I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire. <br /> <br />It is brand new and it won't work.   <br />Everytime I turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes. <br /> <br />I have a wonderful Revlon hair dryer that works great, so I thought it would be good.  The one I have isn't ionic and wanted to try it, guess I'll go back to the old one. <br /> <br />Don't buy it.|neg
Great dryer! Drys hair quickly and leaves hair soft with out the frizzies! <br />Great price shipped quickly with no shipping charges|pos
This item did not work out of the box. I returned it. Should be no stars.|neg
I USED THIS HAIRDRYER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A HYATT HOTEL IN DENVER COLORADO, AND THE RESULTS WERE UNBELIEVABLE!!  THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO BLOW DRY MY LONG HAIR WAS APPROXIMATELY FIVE MINUTES !MY HAIR WAS SO FULL OF BODY AND SHINY--I DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE PRICE WAS TO GET ONE (AND FIGURING THE HYATT USED IT, I WAS READY FOR STICKER SHOCK!) I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I FOUND IT ON AMAZON FOR $19.00. IT IS SO WORTH EVERY DOLLAR--I HAVE TOLD AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE (AND THEY LOOK AT ME LIKE I'M CRAZY!)THE ADDED BONUS IS THE RETRACTABLE CORD AND FOLDING HANDLE--I HAVE HIT THE LOTTERY!|pos
I looked at local retail stores and couldn't find wall mount units.  Don't know why anyone would want one just lying on the counter.  I was skeptical of the Ionic feature, but I believe my hair feels softer and less straw-like after using this dryer.  Feels well made and should last.  At first I thought the high speed wasn't powerful enough, but I think the quietness of this unit is deceptive.  It's really blowing as much air as my old dryer, which was good, but it's so much quieter that you think it's not as powerful.  The night light is quite bright and is a pleasing green, but I wish I could turn it off during the daytime.|pos
A colleague bought one of these and raved about it.  I borrowed it so my wife could try: yes, it is lightweight... but so are most $20 hairdryers.  Wife said it didn't dry any faster, didn't impress her as being anything special.  Someone is laughing hard all the way to the bank with this.|neg
This dryer conked out after I had it only four months. Don't buy it.|neg
2 weeks after I ordered this hairdryer it stopped blowing hot air. It also is much heavier than most hairdryers, and, when it was working,  I really didn't notice a big difference between this hairdryer and regular(non-ionic), less expensive dryers.|neg
I had wanted a hair dryer for xmas which I got. I was so happy that way I didn't have to be under a hooded hair dryer. Well every time I have used it and it's not many, I put the hair dryer on medium heat and it will be okay for a couple of minutes, 5 minutes and automatically shut off. What the hell. Now I have curlers in my hair and this thing decides to shut off when it feels like. This is going straight back to the store. This is the worst hair dryer.  <br />                    Signed wet hair.|neg
I was going to order a T3 from Amazon but after reading the reviews that the manufacturer would not honor the warranty I ordered a Bio Ionic Whisper Light from Amazon for $173.  Works great and because my wife and daughter fight over it I bought another one.  It has a 5 year warranty that WILL be honored.  If T3 wants to loose out on Amazon sales by being jerks about the warranty, let them.|neg
I purchased one of these hair dryers and I love what it does for my hair.  The difference between the T3 and my Remington is a salon quality blow out and my worst hair day.  Only problem, a year after I bought it, it quit working.  I may have gotten a knockoff.  Since I couldn't register it, I'm screwed on the warranty and have to buy a new one.  I believe I probably got a defective one but for $50 more, buy one from Sephora where you can register it.  It's worth it!!!!|neg
This hair dryer really dose make your hair softer, I have had it a month now and I use it only if I have wet hair before bed or going out and it only takes about 5 min to dry my hair (my older one took 30) I highly recimend it.|pos
Ordered this product without reading other reviews first.  Wish I had because these ladies are dead on.  The dryer cuts off as soon as it starts to get hot.  Don't waste your time or money.  It's Saturday.  My hair is wet and set, and I'm left without a dryer.  I've tried three times: twice on high and once on medium setting.  I'm sending this back right away.  Amazon don't let Conair blame this on you.  This model is DEFECTIVE!|neg
Forget about the price, this hairdryer would be great at three times the price. Light weight, quiet and all the options you need.|pos
This is an exceptional value for an exceptional dryer.  I have paid alot more for more well known, brand named dryers.  I have long THICK hair and this product dries my hair in half the time other dryers have done in the past.  Buy this hair dryer, you won't be sorry.|pos
This item was shipped on time, easy to track and works great. Been very pleased with this item|pos
I bought this dryer to replace my 10 year old conair, when it gets hot it would stop.  Good thing I didn't throw it away. This cordkeeper only worked for about 4 months.  It is also very LOUD! ALmost hurt my ears to use it|neg
I have thick, not coarse, but not silky hair.  I rarely blow dry my hair since it takes so long (maybe 7-10 minutes) with my old hair dryer, and I thought it made my hair coarser.  I decided to give the ion thing a try though, and it was the best investment (in time) ever.  It only takes  two or three minutes on high speed, medium heat to dry an entire head of shoulder-length hair!  (I don't blow until it's bone dry, just dry to the touch.)  After the first time, my hair was super soft.  After the second time, it got even softer and I thought it had more body too.  I've only had it a week, so we'll see how it holds up, but the ions really do work.  I'll probably never air dry again!|pos
Well, I finally got tired of the clutter associated with my wife's hair dryer on the bathroom counter and started looking for wall mounted units.  At the time, the Jerdon 1600W had all good reviews and was one of the least expensive options.  We liked its clean and symmetric design better than its competitors.  Anyhow, after 6 weeks of daily use, it still works fine--according to my wife.  It has plenty of power and does have a switch on the handle for off/low/med/high.  If it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base, it automatically flips the switch to the 'off' position.  Most importantly (to me) the bathroom looks clean and uncluttered and I can use the countertop once again.  The only thing that seems a little strange in my home bathroom (rather than a hotel) is that First Class is printed on the handle (as can be seen in the photo).|pos
This is one of the best blow dryers I've ever owned. It dries your hair quickly, and leaves it feeling soft not dried out. I almost didn't purchase it because of the price, but I'm glad I did. You get what you pay for, and this is a great blow dryer.|pos
I owned a Jerdon 1600W wall-mount dryer for 4 years till it finally died of every day normal usage. I then bought this $16.99 model from Amazon that was received DOA. My replacement dryer from Amazon lasted only one week till it went pop and smoked in my hand! Amazon won't send a third replacement but they did refund my credit card. I don't know if the other Jerdon 1600W dryer that Amazon sells at $34.95 is any better(?).|neg
I purchased this dryer in July of 2005.  On Feb 1 of 2006 this dryer sent out sparks and the coils inside were red hot.  I used this once a day almost every day.  I will not be buying another Jerdon hair dryer.|neg
This is a great little hair dryer.  I have one in each bathroom.  It is compact, powerfull and out of the way.|pos
This product is a nightmare! The bonnet refused to completely fill with air and the hose is stiff and not long enough. The bonnet is also made of tissue thin plastic and if the unit would work correctly, the bonnet would most likely not even last a year's worth of use. I patched the hose on my 23 year old general electric hair dryer{which is still working} and decided to deep six the piece of junk!  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!|neg
I have used ionic hairdryers for the last couple of years. Ionic dryers do dryer faster, and with less heat so they are easier on your hair. This was the first one I have seen with a retractable cord, which is what first attracted me.  Be careful not to pull the cord out to far or it doesn't retract well.<br /><br />Over all this is a great little dryer, at a great price.  I say two very enthusiastic thumbs up!|pos
Seemed to work OK at first although I didn't notice much improvment in speed of drying. It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I'm used to. After 6 months, my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine. My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before. My hair stylist noticed it and couldn't figure out what was wrong. After about 9 months, I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again. Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me, and costly!|neg
I was very skeptical of spending so much on a hair dryer.  After reading the great reviews, I figured I would give it a try and hope for the best. I was so eager to try it this morning that I didn't even let my hair partially air dry like I normally do!!  I have never timed how long it takes to dry my hair as I take my time, do part, get tired and come back to it, etc.  My hair is super thick and longish (past my shoulders by a few inches.)  SO, I start to dry my hair and not only did it seem that it dried much faster, but I was able to get it SO much straighter than with my cheapo ionic dryer that I had been using previously.  I usually dry as well as I can and then have to spend another 10 minutes with the iron to smooth out the mess.  I only used the iron for a small section in the back that I hadn't hit well enough with the dryer.  My husband even commented that my hair looked pretty today (I didn't tell him I bought a new dryer!!!!)|pos
I bought this when my Conair travel dryer finally gave up after nearly a decade.  I purchased this specific dryer because of the retractable cord, and love it!  The added benefit is that it dries my hair so quickly, but it was the cord feature that sold me.  Warning: as the previous reviewer mentioned, cats don't like this dryer.  When the cord retracts it must sound like the retracting cord on my vacuum cleaner because my 13 year old cat flies off the bathroom counter as soon as I pull the cord to plug it in.  Otherwise, it's a great little dryer.|pos
I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on a blow dryer and then have it not live up to its claims, but I have to say I am delighted!  My long, curly hair was dry in 7 minutes,  and was soft and not frizzy!!|pos
I just got this dryer for Christmas, and I absolutely love it!  My hair has zero static, which is unusual during the winter.  Usually it takes about 15 minutes, at the minimum, to dry my hair, but with this dryer, it only took 5 minutes!  I would buy this dryer for everyone I know!|pos
I used this hair dryer at my friends place and fell in love.  I showed up at Sephora expecting to pay $50 and saw that it was well over $200.  I bit the bullet and purchased it anyway and it's worth every penny.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.  In fact, it's improved over just towel drying.  Yes, it dries faster and is lighter, but as a male this was a less critical issue.  I really love how it leaves my hair soft, easily manageable (no static), and healthy.  Last week I bought one for my mom and more people are getting them for Christmas.|pos
I have curly hair that I always blow-dry straight. I have paid $300 for hairdryers bought in beauty supply stores...they were so heavy and loud. I was very skeptical to spend more money on yet another dryer, I am so glad I finally did! <br />This dryer is magic. My drying time went from 45min to 15-NO JOKE. My arm never hurts anymore and I am never getting too hot.  <br />I have 0 frizz and it really does make hair shinny. It looks a lot better after 15min now than it ever did with my old 45min drying time. I get compliments on my hair all the time... <br />I rarely write reviews, but I had to get the word out on this exceptional dryer. BUY IT!! :)|pos
LOVE this hair dryer.  My hair used to take forever to dry and this does the job in half the time if not less.  My hair always feels nice and soft after I am finished drying it and is not frizzy.  A huge improvement over my $20 hairdryer from Target.|pos
Great blowdryer!!  I bought this for my master bath since I was redecorating.  Lots of power and heat for a 1600 watt.  The wall mount is absolutely terrific - feel like I'm in a hotel bathroom :-).  The night light is green and some may not like this but it fits in with my decor so I like it.  Can't wait to get another one when I re-do main bathroom.|pos
I bought this hair dryer for my wife who told me that she read it was a really great hair dryer and she wanted one.  Well, I have used it twice myself and, yes, it really is a great hair dryer.  She uses it to straighten her curly hair and it does a terrific job, making it soft and frizz-free.  In that I have curly hair also, I decided to try it and  was surprised when it also straightened my hair.  We have purchased other expensive hair dryers and this one is far and away the best.  I highly recommend it.|pos
Owned one for years. Paid twice this price for my old one. Needed 2 more for second home. Had to order one for a friend after she saw my old one. Keeps dryer always accessable. Never in the way since it has it's own place. Ordered 3 this time.|pos
Received the product in very good time. Price was quite attractive. There aren't many old-fashioned bonnet hair dryers around anymore. This one replaces a decades old GE unit that developed severe rattles and then terminal switch failure. <br /> <br />My wife really likes the compact size, relatively low noise, comfort of the product and storage of the tube and bonnet inside the unit's case. I'd give the style designer a big attaboy. The unit is much easier to store away than the old one. <br /> <br />The only negative comment was that she wishes the unit had one more lower heat option; she gets pretty warm even at low heat. However, she may be happier when our good old Wisconsin winter setles in and the house is a little cooler.|pos
My 10 year old Revlon drier still works, but has seen better days. I checked them all out and decided to stick with Revlon because I love my old travel blowdryer. I was not disappointed. I've had it for almost a month now and I love it. I have long, very thick, and sometimes unruly hair. I live in South Florida, and this dryer works super fast and makes my hair look silky smooth. Thanks Revlon!|pos
This is an expensive hairdryer, but it dried my hair faster than a conventional dryer.  For someone who blowdries her hair every day, that alone makes it worth the $$, but it also made my hair smoother.  Also, there's a 4 year warranty, so there's no risk.  I would highly recommend this product.|pos
I never knew how different a blow-dryer could be until a friend of mine came over with this dryer and I could not believe how good my hair felt afterwards.  I ended up buying the thing that night and threw that other conair one out.  (bought an extra travel one that week too)|pos
I wish I could have read reviews on this product before I bought it.  <br />It was very difficult to put back into its case.  <br />I only used it a few times. The last time it just shut off and never would start again. I would not recommend this product.|neg
I bought this hair dryer recently and was totally dissatisfied. It was very difficult to open the plastic case that housed the bonnet and hose. The dryer turned itself off periodically throughout operation. Save yourself frustation and buy a more expensive model!!|neg
This blowdryer is simply the best. Its cheap and it works so well! it feels like a bargain! I have less flyaways and my hair is shinier! My hair has never looked so good. I had NO problems with the switches or the weight of the dryer. The size is not too big or small and its quiet. All in all it is the best blow dryer I had ever used. To my surprise, theres an ion switch, so you can have it on OR off! Great product.|pos
I bought this hair dryer a couple of months ago, and now it isn't even blowing hot air.  I have bought conair hair dryers before and never will again, just because of my past two bad experiences.  I didn't keep the receipt which is my own fault, but the dryer isn't even six months old and wasn't exactly the most inexpensive dryer in the store.  It just turned me off when it quit working.|neg
As a child of the Sixties, I still wear my hair long and I blow it dry every morning. When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine. I'm waiting for our good friends at Consumer Reports to weigh in on the benefits (or lack thereof) of dual ion ports, but after a week of daily use with the ion switch ON, I've noticed that my hair doesn't fight me as much when I brush it into place. Even when the static-charged Santa Ana winds are howling through sunny SoCal, my hair doesn't stick out like porcupine quills. And, yes, if I turn my head from side to side, there's a noticeable shimmer that either wasn't there before or I had never noticed it.<br />A minor flaw is that the power and ion switches respond to a very light push, but after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer. The dryer offers low and high air-speed/heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed. Cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly.<br />So, whether ions really do or don't make a difference, the overall performance of the Conair Ion Shine is worth the price.ut after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer.

I purchased this dryer for about (a little money). one week before I purchased my professional Solano Super X (SSX) for (for more money). and after using this one for about one week, then using the SSX for another, I went back to this one and noticed the difference in my hair immediately.  My hair much is smoother, shinier and the (split) ends lay flat with the Revlon ION. My hair doesn't feel like it's parched compared to when I use the SSX.  Yes, it's not an expensive professional dryer so it may not last as long as the SSX (I won't know because I won't be using the SSX any longer) but it makes my hair look 100% better after it's dried than the professional dryer does and it's a much quicker, healthier dry time.  I receive compliments on my hair when I have used the Revlon ION dryer, and needless to say, no compliments on my hair when I have used the SSX.  Buy one, make sure to leave the ION setting ON (not sure why you would NOT want to), you won't not be disappointed!!|pos
I just bought this dryer today after my other Conair stopped working.  It takes SOOOOOOO LONG for me to dry my hair now...i can barely even feel it!  It messes up my hair more than my other one did.  As for helping my hair......yeah right.  Same ole frizzies as always.  I'm going to try and take it back.|neg
I thought I had a fairly decent blowdryer...until it died.  Now I'm glad the thing is gone.  My hair is thick and has always taken a long time to dry.  Thank you Revlon for cutting my drying time in half.  My hair has a smoother texture and is much softer with this blowdryer.  Since I started using it people have been commenting on how nice my hair looks.  I was skeptical after reading the online reviews but after reading about the other blowdryers I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did!|pos
I looked at this hair dryer for two reasons: (1) as a back-up to my $100 hair dryer my salon sells and (2) something I could keep in my gym bag. I have long, naturally curly, thick hair that I like to wear very straight to the office. Both my expensive hair dryer and this hair dryer get my hair straight and very smooth. The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         I'd highly recommend this hair dryer. One thing to note: I do not notice any difference when using the ion switch (depends on hair type?). But with the multiple settings and the air-flow nozzle, this is a great product. I've had this hair dryer for six months and felt compelled to write because most commercial stores don't sell quality hair dryers like this one.|pos
Can you actually love an appliance? B/c this dryer is great! I have long thick wavy hair and with my old dryer it took 30 minutes to dry, with this dryer only 15 minutes!!! Its so light weight my arm doesn't hurt. My hair is softer after one use. I used to hate drying my hair, now I look forward to it. If you are looking for a dryer just buy this one, its absolutely great!It delivers everything it promises. You'll love it.|pos
I have very thick, curly hair and recently got a new, short style that I wanted to blow straight.  I had an older dryer that just didn't cut it - so I did some research and purchased this one.  I absolutely love it.  It blows my hair straight very fast and all the frizz is gone too.|pos
I was a little skeptical about the reviews that I read. I had doubts of how a blow dryer can give you shine and reduce freeze, and what was this ion thing. Well, for someone who has two left hands for blow drying her hair this blow dryer is a God's sent. I blew dry my hair with this brow dryer and with the next time I had to wash my hair I dried it with my old blow dryer. For someone who lives in Miami, Florida and where humidity is 1000%, this blow dryer works amazing.      The blow dryer deliveries what it promises. My hair was shinier and freeze control. Bottom line, I highly recommend it. It is definitely money well spent.|pos
.<BR>Powerful. Multi-speed, multi-temperature. Ionizer. What else could you wish? Great!!|pos
One of the main reasons why I selected this dryer over others was the ion setting and the sleek look of the dryer. It gave volume and shine to my hair. I felt the buttons on the dryer to be slightly awkward because they can be easily depressed when in use. There is really no heat setting but with the addition of the cool shot, I can sort of control the heat. The high/low buttons is just the speed. My mother, who also uses it, felt it to be a bit large and heavy, but I didn't have that sort of problem, so I guess if you are a bit petite, you might want something smaller, other than that, I think it's great.|pos
I have thick shoulder length hair, that usually takes 35 - 40 minutes to dry. With this dryer, I'm done in 20 minutes and my hair looks smooth and soft.  I was skeptical about the whole ionizing thing, but it has made a big difference with my hair.  The removable<BR>filter was the deciding factor.  I've thrown away dryers just because I couldn't clean them. Excellent product!|pos
I just purchased this dryer, and I really like the way my hair looks. It does what it says, drys it in much shorter time, and a much healthier feel...my head isn't on fire. It doesn't seem like hair would dry as fast as it does...but it works!|pos
I purchased it because it was supposed to be quiet. It's every bit as loud as my old dryer. It's heavy, cumbersome, hard to manage. I kept turning it off because of the location of the buttons on the handle (I didn't have that problem with my old dryer). It kept sucking my hair in the motor area. <br />BUT, I do think there's something to this ion thing. My hair seemed softer and straighter - no frizzies. It also seemed to dry faster. So, I am now on a quest to find a ion dryer that is light, quiet and easy to manage - oh, and doesn't eat my hair.|neg
I love this dryer not only is it QUIET, it really does make my hair shiny and silky.  I bought this because I simply needed a dryer and thought if it could do anything else it would just be a bonus.   I have straight hair which tends to be more shiney than layered, I liked how my hair felt-particularly here where it can be extremely humid. I was pleasantly surprised.  Although another reviewer found the weight a problem, it was no heavier than my old dryer. I love it!!!!|pos
This hairdryer far exceeded my expection for<BR>volumizing and adding shine.<br />I have limp and fine hair and had tried anything<BR>from volumizing shampoo, hot curlers to mega-hold<BR>hair spray. Nothing was ever so satisfying and lasting as<BR>the results I got from this hair dryer.  I<BR>blow dry as I normally would and my hair looks<BR>bouncy and shiny right away.
