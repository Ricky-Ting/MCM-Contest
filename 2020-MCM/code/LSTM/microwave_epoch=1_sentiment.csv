reviews in the past but never have i seen so much debate and misinformation about what would seem to be a simple kitchen appliance a lot of the reviews i have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges samsung or whoever the samsung dealer on here is has only added to the confusion unfortunatelybr br first a few points to set the record straight the appliance is not covered in stainless steel there may be a bit of it in the trim but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasnt actually sen one in person most of the outside has a black textured metal finish which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances it may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it thoughbr br there is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction which is limited to the trim 34open button34 and part of the door latch i have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance in fact the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnetbr br another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode which is not true the rack can be used in the combination grillmicrowave mode just fine and your microwave will not burst into flames from the manual page 11 34grill rack to be placed on the turntable the metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking34 it will even 34work34 in the microwaveonly setting although it wont contribute to the cooking process at all in fact the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave and grill at the same time and you cant utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in placebr br this brings me to the main point of my review those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave this is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison is it heavier than most standalone microwaves of course it is because it has an entirely separate heating element electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior this is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta pizza crusts etc the additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than standalone microwaves which is entirely understandable to me this also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavyduty microwaves if used with the grill though it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage ratingbr br adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of standalone microwaves on the market the reason for this is pretty simple to keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance without the heavyduty which is necessarily heavy inside and outside finishes the device has it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned for those who wonder why it doesnt have more capacity or more wattage the reasons all boil down to safety you can only add so much shielding to keep the size and cost of such an appliance practical i think that samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave doesbr br in regards to cost i have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks at one point i believe it was 179 shipping included then it went up to 230 shipping not included today it is down to 19999 with free shipping i have no idea what the msrp of the unit actually is but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries it seems like at bargain to mebr br for me personally this product is just the right size for the foods i cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how i can cook things the polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen ever it reminds me a lot of my samsung galaxy s4 cellphone actually all in all i couldnt be happier with my purchase and i would recommend it to anyone if you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldnt want to buy this though because it is definitely more expensive than a standalone microwave if you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill id never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though i am too spoiled with this products cooking ability at this point in any event i think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here try it for yourself and i would bet that you wont be disappointedn to 19999 with free shipping i have no

(The preheat setting is problematic to say the least),i picked this unit up primarily for the convection oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility that said the unit is not without issuesbr br the short story is the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit the grill function is great  provided you use the pan that comes with the unit the convection function is wonderful but never and i mean never use parchment paper in the unit fire the preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting the unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built the two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well madebr br now for those who are interested the long storybr br microwavebr br works just great seemed to have more power than my built in unit so i did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit the kids and i have learned to dial the time back when we use this unitbr br grillbr br love this feature i made the following  grilled cheese upper rack and pan  7 minutes with flip at half way point turned out beautifully open face bagel with cheese upper rack and pan  5 minutes grilled to perfectionbr br convection ovenbr br i had pretty good but not perfect results here baked russet potatoes medium were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting sweet potato fries were kind of a disappointment as well they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven chicken breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but i did note that ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result french bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper  the paper caught fire i checked the manual about using parchment paper  i use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking  and there was no warning about using it  but i can tell you it is a big nonobr br preheat functionbr br well this function is pretty worthless on my unit i have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks i have had the unit the first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up the next time we used it it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down it completely turns off including the time display and will not work at all the next time i let it cycle through both the preheat and 10 minute cycle the unit remained functional and i was able to convection bake afterwards then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook  the unit shut down again as i said we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey sometimes the unit remains functional sometimes it shuts down the hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in usebr br slim frybr br we have not tried this function yet but i will update when we do perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven friesbr br overall this is a better multifunction machine than i thought it would be i was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units toaster ovenconvection oven have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best the oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs regular oven on this unit and you should be fine  for the price the unit seems a solid investment my only reservation being the preheat function which i think i will just chose to not use going forwardbr br recommended with above reservations,1/16/2015,0.52070016

down door, and eco mode in stainless steel",Major Appliances,3,182,192,Y,N,Takes your chef skills down a few notches,im always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device my past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre but one thing i can say after running this samsung multifunction baking broiling microwave convection oven through its paces is that it really does everything very very well because the interface is not intuitive more on this in a moment you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to you will also have to extrapolate a little bit because samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method still by keeping the manual handy i didnt have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that i tried everything except broiling  which looks like it would be quite messybr br i started simple with the microwave while every microwave that i have touched in the past twenty years was literally selfexplanatory just choose a setting or power level and cook time this samsung oven requires you to select the type of food the weight what you are trying to accomplish heat defrost etc and it calculates everything for you and runs it now this sounds like a lot of tedious work and in fact it is but the first thing i defrosted was frozen japanese sticky rice in a regular microwave i usually just put it in at high level for a minute stir it up and i end up with a sometimes mushy sometimes not sometimes cold or cool or hot sometimes perfect sometimes inedible bowl of rice using the bread setting on the samsung i put the rice in pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions and i ended up with perfectly defrosted not hot not cold not a grain neglected bowl of rice it was in a word amazing defrosted without even getting hot wow the microwave continued to impress in this fashion popping popcorn defrosting frozen berries warming cold bread all to perfectionbr br for baking or actual heating again following the instructions of the manual i made a number of excellent dishes what i failed to notice however was that the cook times for everything i made were predetermined by the oven that is to say before starting i never knew how long anything would take and in fact until you push the start button the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious this didnt matter for the most part until i tried the slim fry functionbr br now i have experience with these so called oilless fryers which is essentially what the samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode so i prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep but before i did that i started on the potatoes the first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this i turned it on and set to work on my other dishes eight minutes later i was ready to go but the oven was still fast  preheating i cut to the chase put in my potatoes on the crisper tray set it on the small rack that came with the oven is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack selected my quantity and hit start the timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes wait 32 minutes i could drive to mcdonalds order fries sit in the parking lot and eat them go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and id still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the samsung we had a fryless dinner and slim fries admittedly delicious crispy and light fries for dessertbr br i dont know a serious chef who doesnt work within given time constraints its part of the task after all there are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows so if you ask me how exactly is a chef supposed to get the most out of this samsung i have to answer honestly i have no clue not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap i suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions and kept notes along the way you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven but as it is i think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave but with the quirky implements requiredreading manual and the well let you know when it will be done when were ready to let you know feature it is impossible to rate this any higher than three starse even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows

down door, and eco mode in stainless steel",Major Appliances,3,19,27,N,N,It Misses the Point of Being a Multi-Function Appliance,i am really upset i just got a mc11h6033 11 cuft counter top convection microwave wslim fry as a gift i contacted the chat support as i had a few questions all of which were answered with no but only after i was basically told yes to all three questions and then dared to question the yesbr br i asked if there was a timer function told yes then told no after i asked the rep to tell me where it was located and how to set and use it who makes a microwave in 2014 that doesnt have a timerbr br i asked if there was a more extensive food prep guiderecipe book available to use with the unit because the microwave oven owners instructions  cooking guide literally only lists 1 food item per function theres 1000s of foods that could be made using things like the slim fry function but no way to know which of the 19 settings to use because theres only 9 food items listed in the microwave oven owners instructions  cooking guide under the slim fry entry there is apparently no app with this information available either neither is there a formula for figuring out how to slim fry additional foods other than those listed in the microwave oven owners instructions  cooking guide this problem persists throughout the microwave oven owners instructions  cooking guide in that every function other than straight microwave or straight convection cooking does not give enough information to be able to choose the correct function and setting for foods other than those listed i only found this information out after asking which setting to use to cook prebreaded fried okra i was answered you can use the slim fry option 2 for prebreaded frozen fried okra i asked how and where did you find that information he replied i have gathered the information from our internal database i stated i dont exactly have access to your internal database now do i so no additional cooking info publicly available i guess if i want to try to slim fry frozen cheese sticks ill need to contact customer service and ask which setting to use because apparently in the world of frozen food prebreaded frozen fried okra is equal to that of frozen prawns [shrimp] breaded thats the example food for slim fry option 2 as per the microwave oven owners instructions  cooking guidebr br i asked if there were sheet pans cookware or bakeware available to be purchased from samsung or elsewhere that were known to fit in the unit specifically sheet pans standard size 14 quarter sheet pans wont fit because the 95 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself no standard 95 x 13 sheet pan is 95 x 13 on the outside dimensions that i am aware of so where would i get pans that fit apparently customer service nor parts has a clue who makes the inside of an appliance capable of being a convection oven too small for standard size bakeware toaster ovens dont count  but they do at least have aftermarket sheet pans available out there that fit in them if id wanted to make cookies on pans that small id have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time not a convection microwave oven it should also be noted the microwave oven owners instructions  cooking guide makes a big deal out of you choosing the proper cookware this is covered from pg 22 to pg 25br br i was told by customer service initially that what i was looking for was available and to contact parts about those last two questions i did i checked online and i called the girl who answered actually hung up on me after i insisted that customer service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available after she ended our conversation abruptly i brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the customer service rep i was chatting withbr br other than the above the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well the dropdown oven style door is a really nice feature the blue display lighting is prettybr br how does a company make a product without giving the consumer or providing to the consumer at an additional charge adequate instruction or equipment to use their product i just dont understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them obviously people like me dont test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their productbr br obviously my logic is lost on samsung  or its too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out in any case with a hefty 249 on sale to 399 full retail price tag the mc11h6033 11 cuft counter top convection microwave with slim fry is definitely not worth the money since you cant use it to its full potentialbr br review updatebr so as of christmas day i still hadnt found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit my mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster ovenbr br i was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time id only used the slim fry feature to that point to cook a dish for christmas dinner all of a sudden it just stopped working the unit head cut off and there was no display visible i thought maybe id tripped the breaker i unplugged the unit and checked i had not tripped the breaker but i turned it off and back on just to be sure i plug the unit back in and nothing ive been found something else to plug into that outlet so that i can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly it was i then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section it recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in i unplugged it and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes i plugged it back in and still nothingbr br for a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time definitely says nothing good about the unit for the unit to conk out while making christmas dinner that was just a headache i didnt need that day i would dub this a completely unreliable unitbr br i regret that i never did have the chance to try french fries using the slim fry option,12/4/2014,0.502363

their review is not for this improved model if you have an advantium oven with the peeling door handle dont just order the handle  replace the whole door it is a new handle design that addresses the problem my door was replaced under warrantybr br bought a new house miss our oven so much were having one installed here if youre considering one remember thisbr br 1 you cannot run it as a microwave with the metal tray andor racks in  it will dramatically shorten its lifebr 2 you cannot run it as an oven without the metal tray at least in  it will dramatically shorten its lifebr 3 you cannot soak the control panel down with soapy water to clean it  you can short it out you clean it simply by wiping with a microfiber cloth donebr br all three of these points are in the owners manual  which im going to speculate a lot of people dont read when i sold my last house i purposely put the owners manual around all the racks outside of the oven and wrote a note to the new owner 34do not use until

and worthless timer.,i wanted to replace our ge spacemaker overtherange 30 microwave and found this model that matched well  we actually have the black version but it is otherwise identical  the samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the ge with a redesigned front panel  i knew and trusted the samsung brand from our personal electronics such as several smartphones so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer  unfortunately what i got was a barebones minimal redesign with major flaws  its like they took the basic ge design made it super cheap and replaced the panel with a terrible nonintuitive redesignbr br installation was easy  i was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the samsung was indeed a twin of the ge series  this microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side  i had to drill new holes through the cabinet above however as the top was slightly different  the height is 16 for the main cabinet 16 58 to the very bottom of the light box underneath not shown in the picture but its there  i plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isnt the same quality as the ge wasbr br the first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel  the buttons are hard to interpret and things that are easy on the ge are now impossible or very confusing  heating a beverage is common right  no beverage button on this unit  you need to discover the button to press is cook and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 nextbr br what about canned vegetables  theres a veggies button so this should be easy  not so  press the button and across scrolls select  pause  1 for  pause  fresh  pause again  veggies  um i know its vegetables i just pressed the button  2 for  yet another pause  frozen  darn guess it must be 3  veggies  clear  select  oh no where can frozen veggies be  etc  at least the select doesnt scroll when it appears only when its scrolling away  but the worst part is seeing the veggies on the display alone as i wait knowing full well i pressed the veggies buttonbr br and i still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light  making it worse is that there is one button for the light hilooff and 2 buttons for the fan onoff and 4 speed  actually there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use  sure there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which but those are only visible up close in bright lightbr br gone are the easy 1button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons  now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds  i could go on and on about the poor interface but i think you get the ideabr br next major issue the stovetop light is way dimmer than the ge was  even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs and my ge had 2 halogen bulbs this one has a single incandescent bulb  not bright at all  this is huge as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly litbr br and a another biggie when the timer finishes it gives 4 short quiet beeps and stops  no repeat nothing more  so unless you are right by it it is pretty much worthless  we can now only use our oven timer  so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things  i cant even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timerbr br the look is also unattractive  the lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is  even the display is an ugly oldfashioned blue 14segment per digit 7digit display  most calculators have better  actually i kind of like the blue  everything else in my kitchen is amber so it creates a nice contrastbr br furthermore it is noisy  it frequently makes weird grindinglike noises from the bottom right i think it is a fan or the microwave element  if i tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a whilebr br finally the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it  samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasnt happened again in the many months sincebr br is there anything i like about this microwave  well it works  it has a turntable  it has sensor cooking  and it has dual greasefilters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan that has 4 levels when not using the microwave 2 when in use  it also has an easytoclean allwhite

a 2434 wide x 1234 deep space  not intended to be installed above a range standard ranges are 3034 wide does not include a builtin hood for use above a rangebr 62 has the great simple operation of previous spacemakers for example to heat a cup of coffee 1 minute place it in the microwave and press 34134  thats allbr 62 well built albeit with more plastic and less metal than my old spacemaker iibr 62 quieter than my old spacemaker iialthough thats no big dealbr 62 the turntable is a nice addition my old spacemaker ii did not have a turntable but reduces the total space available unless you turn the turntable offbr 62 has all of the controls and options of my old spacemaker iibr plus popcorn 34beverage34 34reheat34 34chickenfish34 34potato34 and 34vegetable34 buttons which i probably

press it and get just 30 seconds or add 30 seconds to any time  30 seconds is ideal for warming a cup of coffee or heating some pastriesbr there is a child lockout but without a dedicated buttonbr br undercounter installationbr 62 the microwave itself comes with a paper template for drilling the necessary holes but the template can be confusing and may not apply in all casesbr 62 the microwave hangs from four 1 1434long machine screws which are inserted from above from inside the cabinet above  if the floor of the cabinet is greater than 1234 thick then the length of the screws needs to be equal to the thickness of the floor plus 1234br 62 hypothetically you could install the microwave with the four screws from your local hardware store and 4 big washers eg 234 in diameter  however the installation kit is probably easierbr 62 if you use the template double check the logic and adjust the location of the screw holes accordinglybr  the key measurement is the distance from the front holes to the front of the cabinet you usually want the front of the microwave to be flush with the front of the closed doors of the cabinet  that is the front holes should be approximately 3 1434 back from the front of the closed doorsbr  the door of the microwave needs an extra 1834 on the left in order to open fully and the grill for the ventilation fan is on the left side of the microwave  if there is an obstruction on the left side such as wall cabinet or refrigerator you may wish to shift the holes 1434 to the right if you canbr br undercounter installation kitbr 62 if this is an new undercounter installation or the space between the front and back screw holes inside the cabinet above the microwave is not 6 1434 then you need ge part wx4a019 [[asinb001h815to ge part number wx4a019 under cab mt]]  if you are replacing a spacemaker with a distance of 6 1434 between the front and back holes then you probably do not need an installation kitbr br if you are replacing an old spacemaker ii for which the spacing between the front and rear screw holes is 7 3434br 62 i purchased this profile spacemaker to replace a 23year old spacemaker ii  but neither the holes backing plate nor the screws were the samebr 62 the spacing from the cabinet front to the forward screw holes is almost the same for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemakerbr 62 the lateral spacing sidetoside between the screw holes is the same 19 153234 for my old spacemaker ii and this new profile spacemakerbr 62 but the spacing between the front and rear holes is not the same the new spacing is 6 1434br 62so if the holes in your cabinet are for the old spacemaker ii then you need only drill new rear holes in your cabinet for this profile spacemaker  draw a line on the cabinet between the centers of the existing front and back holes measure 6 1434 back from the center of the front hole and drill the new hole therebr 62 the screws seem to be very similar but a slightly different diameter or pitch perhaps they are metric hypothetically you could drill new holes in the old backing plate or use washers instead of the backing plate and find screws the right size and length but i decided to purchase the new kit insteadbr br before you replace a dead microwave oven br 62 my old spacemaker ii died three times over 23 years as the result of power surges lightning  i accidentally learned that the trick is to unplug the microwave overnight for the electronics to reset  ive had the same experience with several other appliancesbr 62 even refrigerators and clothes driers have builtin computers these days  if any electric appliance is not working properly unplug it and leave it unplugged a while  for some reason perhaps large capacitors in the circuit big appliances usually need hours to resetbr br reliabilitybr if my experience with my old spacemaker ii is any indication this profile spacemaker should be very reliable  although resurrected 3 times over 23 years my old spacemaker was still working when i 34took it out of service34  after 23 years of daily use some of the white finish was turning yellow there were patches of rust inside and the door switch which turns the light on and off was erraticbr br if your old spacemaker had a tray instead of a turntable keep the tray from your old microwavebr 62 the tray will fit in your new profile spacemaker  the tray will catch spills and protect the bottom of the microwave from abrasion and burnton spills which may promote rust in the futurebr 62 i use the glass tray when im using a large rectangular casserole or many small containers  i often warm two 1234 diameter full plates of foodi use a small glass storage container as a spacer so that the plates can overlapbr 62 if you use the tray lift out the glass turntable and rollers and turn off the turntable drive then place the glass tray in the bottombr br general hints on microwave cookingbr it is largely steam created by the microwaves which does the cooking so the key to cooking many items especially vegies is to generate and hold that steambr 62 if you are warming bread wrap it in a towel  it is astounding how effective a single layer of paper towel can be  if the bread is rock hard slightly dampen the towel and use halfpowerthe warm bread will be soft and fresh  heat only briefly andor at reduced powerbr 62 you can even bake

the unit it was replacing than any flaws in this unit so i wont count that as a strike against this productbr br in the few months that we have been using this unit there are several things that ive noticed that have made me regret this purchasebr br 1 the glass plate split in two after about two weeks of use i have no idea why this occured my wife stuck in a bowl of oatmeal to cook it and after about 30 seconds there was a loud bang and she turned it off to see what had happened the glass plate was spilt into two pieces nearly right down the middle weird the replacement part cost me another 30 not happy about thisbr br 2 the venting fan has a flap that opens to the duct inside the wall the hinge on this flap is very weak and we can hear it flapping about on windy days this seems very irregular as the kitchen wall this unit is mounted on is an inside wall not an exterior wall and the ductwork goes up through the roof not to the nearest exterior wall i really dont think it should do this the last unit did not do this and its a bit irritating to hear this flap rattling and squeaking around on windy daysbr br 3 this microwave positively will not cook a good bag of microwave popping corn whats up with that isnt that a basic necessity of every microwave put in a bag of popping corn and you either get 25 of it popped with wet greasy kernels or 75 popped and its all burned brown and stinky the first few times i figured my wife was losing her mind and just counldnt figure out the new unit well i have now tried four different brands of popping corn and got the same results with all brands for a family that really enjoys microwave popping corn this was a real bummer and the number one reason i would never recommend this microwave to another personbr br 4 in general terms this microwave seems underpowered it claims to have the same wattage cooking power as the model it replaced but im not seeing it everything takes longer to cook with this unit sure in microwave terms youre only talking about 15 longer cook times which equal out to mere seconds or a few more minutes so its not a lot of extra time but its just worse than i expected you always kind of assume that the new model will be better than the old but that just wasnt the case in this instancebr br 5 ok this one is just personal preference and not really a problem with the unit i probably should have inquired about this feature before purchasing this product i prefer microwaves that you just pop food into press the seconds or minutes you want to cook something and then press start on this unit you need to press a button marked cook time before you start pressing any numbers if you press any number at the start the unit powers up and begins cooking the food by the number of minutes assigned to that

Life,e j tastads review of this product is accurate and appropriate but i would like to add some additional information  i bought this ge profile microwave oven in march of 2006 on the recommendation of consumer reports  in september 2009 i am sorry to report that i had to throw it out because it wasnt worth repairing  consumer reports gave this ge model their top rating for large microwave ovens  it replaced an old amana radarrange that i had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames  the amana had also received consumer reports top rating back then  if i recall my amana sold for about twice as much money in 1981 dollars as this ge costs in 2006 dollarsbr br since this microwave oven is more powerful faster and consumes more electricity than small models you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use  compared with my old amana the ge has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating probably because the food is rotated on a turntable  as e j tastad found the defrost cycle is easy to use gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive  the stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to cleanbr br unlike my old amana this oven cannot multitask  for example if youre running the builtin clock timer you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions  you must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa  you also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old amana could accommodate nor can you program it to start at a later timebr br this microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old amana did  the magnetron tube in my ge profile microwave oven failed after two years of use  its replacement was covered by the fiveyear ge warranty on the tube but the warranty didnt cover the 85 in labor charges which would have been even more if i had received the service onsite instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot  after 3 12 years of use september 2009 the main circuit board selfdestructed  it cost me 44 at the nearest ge repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another 200 to replace the microwave ovens circuit boardbr br since other brands of similarsized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs i have discarded this microwave oven after 3 12 years and after spending 129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price  given this experience i now be hardpressed to recommend this appliance considering its costofownership and short life  this appliance should have lasted much longer  it did not get heavy use and was never misused or abusedbr br when i contacted ge about my failed microwave oven they promised to make things right asked for the model and serial number and requested that i cut off the appliances power cord and plug and send it to them  they then sent me a 100 rebate check that could be applied only to another ge appliance purchase  the check expired before i found another ge appliance that i wanted to ownbr br i bought a replacement which was a panasonic model nnsd978s microwave oven for less than 200 from sams club  it is just as large cooks faster and has proven to be far more reliable  after four years its still going strong without need for repairsore if i had received
